abstract="Radiative forcing is a useful tool for predicting equilibrium global temperature change. However, it is not so useful for predicting global precipitation changes, as changes in precipitation strongly depend on the climate change mechanism and how it perturbs the atmospheric and surface energy budgets. Here a suite of climate model experiments and radiative transfer calculations are used to quantify and assess this dependency across a range of climate change mechanisms. It is shown that the precipitation response can be split into two parts: a fast atmospheric response that strongly correlates with the atmospheric component of radiative forcing, and a slower response to global surface temperature change that is independent of the climate change mechanism, similar to 2-3\% per unit of global surface temperature change. We highlight the precipitation response to black carbon aerosol forcing as falling within this range despite having an equilibrium response that is of opposite sign to the radiative forcing and global temperature change.

abstract = {Climate models struggle to accurately represent the highly reflective boundary layer clouds overlying the remote and stormy Southern Ocean. We use in-situ aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation and Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) to evaluate Southern Ocean clouds in a cloud-resolving large-eddy simulation (LES) and two coarse resolution global atmospheric models, the CESM Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) and the GFDL global atmosphere model (AM4), run in a nudged hindcast framework.  We develop six case studies from SOCRATES data which span the range of observed cloud and boundary layer properties. For each case, the LES is run once forced purely using reanalysis data (`ERA5-based’) and once strongly nudged to an aircraft profile (`Obs-based’).  The ERA5-based LES can be compared with the global models, which are also nudged to reanalysis data, and is better for simulating cumulus.  The Obs-based LES closely matches an observed cloud profile and is useful for microphysical comparisons and sensitivity tests, and simulating multi-layer stratiform clouds.  We use two-moment Morrison microphysics in the LES and find that it simulates too few frozen particles in clouds occurring within the Hallett-Mossop temperature range.  We modify the Hallett-Mossop parameterization so that it activates within boundary layer clouds and we achieve better agreement between observed and simulated microphysics.  The nudged GCMs achieve reasonable supercooled liquid water dominated clouds in most cases but struggle to represent multi-layer stratiform clouds and to maintain liquid water in cumulus clouds.  CAM6 has low droplet concentrations in all cases and underestimates stratiform cloud-driven turbulence.}

abstract="It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

abstract="The authors study the role of clouds in the persistent bias of surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR) in the Southern Ocean in the atmosphere-only version of the Met Office model. The reduction of this bias in the atmosphere-only version is important to minimize sea surface temperature biases when the atmosphere model is coupled to a dynamic ocean. The authors use cloud properties and radiative fluxes estimates from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and apply a clustering technique to classify clouds into different regimes over the Southern Ocean. Then, they composite the cloud regimes around cyclone centers, which allows them to study the role of each cloud regime in a mean composite cyclone. Low- and midlevel clouds in the cold-air sector of the cyclones are responsible for most of the bias. Based on this analysis; the authors develop and test a new diagnosis of shear-dominated boundary layers. This change improves the Simulation of the SDSR through a better simulation of the frequency of occurrence of the cloud regimes in the cyclone composite. Substantial biases in the radiative properties of the midtop and stratocumulus regimes are still present, which suggests the need to increase the optical depth of the low-level cloud with moderate optical depth and cloud with tops at midlevels.",

abstract="Current climate models generally reflect too little solar radiation over the Southern Ocean, which may be the leading cause of the prevalent sea surface temperature biases in climate models. The authors study the role of clouds on the radiation biases in atmosphere-only simulations of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (CFMIP2), as clouds have a leading role in controlling the solar radiation absorbed at those latitudes. The authors composite daily data around cyclone centers in the latitude band between 40 degrees and 70 degrees S during the summer. They use cloud property estimates from satellite to classify clouds into different regimes, which allow them to relate the cloud regimes and their associated radiative biases to the meteorological conditions in which they occur. The cloud regimes are defined using cloud properties retrieved using passive sensors and may suffer from the errors associated with this type of retrievals. The authors use information from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) lidar to investigate in more detail the properties of the midlevel cloud regime. Most of the model biases occur in the cold-air side of the cyclone composite, and the cyclone composite accounts for most of the climatological error in that latitudinal band. The midlevel regime is the main contributor to reflected shortwave radiation biases. CALIPSO data show that the midlevel cloud regime is dominated by two main cloud types: cloud with tops actually at midlevel and low-level cloud. Improving the simulation of these cloud types should help reduce the biases in the simulation of the solar radiation budget in the Southern Ocean in climate models.",

This feedback is commonly attributed to an increase in cloud optical depth due to ice to liquid phase change as the climate warms. Here we use a cyclone compositing technique to show that the models' cloud liquid water path (LWP) response is strongly dependent on cloud regime. The radiative and LWP responses are not as tightly coupled as a zonal-mean analysis would suggest, implying that the physical mechanisms that control the overall LWP response are not necessarily responsible for the radiative response. The area of the cyclone dominated by low-level stratiform and shallow convective clouds plays a dominant role in the radiative response. Since these are mostly supercooled liquid clouds, the strength of a negative cloud phase feedback in the real world should be smaller than the one predicted by current models.",

abstract="The Southern Ocean is a critical region for global climate, yet large cloud and solar radiation biases over the Southern Ocean are a long-standing problem in climate models and are poorly understood, leading to biases in simulated sea surface temperatures. This study shows that supercooled liquid clouds are central to understanding and simulating the Southern Ocean environment. A combination of satellite observational data and detailed radiative transfer calculations is used to quantify the impact of cloud phase and cloud vertical structure on the reflected solar radiation in the Southern Hemisphere summer. It is found that clouds with supercooled liquid tops dominate the population of liquid clouds. The observations show that clouds with supercooled liquid tops contribute between 27{\%} and 38{\%} to the total reflected solar radiation between 40 degrees and 70 degrees S, and climate models are found to poorly simulate these clouds. The results quantify the importance of supercooled liquid clouds in the Southern Ocean environment and highlight the need to improve understanding of the physical processes that control these clouds in order to improve their simulation in numerical models. This is not only important for improving the simulation of present-day climate and climate variability, but also relevant for increasing confidence in climate feedback processes and future climate projections.",

abstract="We analyze the atmospheric processes that explain the large changes in radiative feedbacks between the two latest climate configurations of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental model. We use a large set of atmosphere-only climate change simulations (amip and amip-p4K) to separate the contributions to the differences in feedback parameter from all the atmospheric model developments between the two latest model configurations. We show that the differences are mostly driven by changes in the shortwave cloud radiative feedback in the midlatitudes, mainly over the Southern Ocean. Two new schemes explain most of the differences: the introduction of a new aerosol scheme and the development of a new mixed-phase cloud scheme. Both schemes reduce the strength of the preexisting shortwave negative cloud feedback in the midlatitudes. The new aerosol scheme dampens a strong aerosol-cloud interaction, and it also suppresses a negative clear-sky shortwave feedback. The mixed-phase scheme increases the amount of cloud liquid water path (LWP) in the present day and reduces the increase in LWP with warming. Both changes contribute to reducing the negative radiative feedback of the increase of LWP in the warmer climate. The mixed-phase scheme also enhances a strong, preexisting, positive cloud fraction feedback. We assess the realism of the changes by comparing present-day simulations against observations and discuss avenues that could help constrain the relevant processes.",

The variance is found to increase with spatial scale, but also depends strongly on the cloud or rain fraction regime, with overcast regions containing less variability than broken cloud fields. This variability is shown to lead to large biases, up to a factor of 4, in both the autoconversion and accretion rates estimated at a model grid scale of approximate to 40 km by a typical microphysical parametrization using in-cloud mean values. A parametrization for the subgrid variability of liquid cloud and rainwater content is developed, based on the observations, which varies with both the grid scale and cloud or rain fraction, and is applicable for all model grid scales. It is then shown that if this parametrization of the variability is analytically incorporated into the autoconversion and accretion rate calculations, the bias is significantly reduced.",

	Abstract = {The effect of cloud droplet sedimentation on the entrainment rate and
   liquid water path of a nocturnal nondrizzling stratocumulus layer is
   examined using large-eddy simulations (LES) with bulk microphysics. In
   agreement with a prior study by Ackerman et al. (2004), sedimentation is
   found to decrease entrainment rate and thereby increase liquid water
   path. They suggested this is due to reduction of boundary-layer
   turbulence. Our simulations suggest otherwise. Instead, sedimentation
   reduces entrainment by removing liquid water from the entrainment zone.
   This inhibits two mechanisms that promote the sinking of entrained air
   into the cloud layer entrainment-induced evaporative cooling and
   longwave radiative cooling. A sensitivity study shows that the radiative
   effect is less important than the reduced evaporation. A possible
   parameterization of the effect of sedimentation on entrainment rate in a
   mixed layer model is proposed and tested. Since the droplet
   sedimentation rate is inversely related to cloud droplet (and presumably
   aerosol) concentration and nearly nondrizzling marine stratocumulus are
   widespread, sedimentation impacts on stratocumulus entrainment
   efficiency should be considered in climate model simulations of the

abstract="Exploiting the observed robust relationships between temperature and optical depth in extratropical clouds, we calculate the shortwave cloud feedback from historical data, by regressing observed and modeled cloud property histograms onto local temperature in middle to high southern latitudes. In this region, all CMIP5 models and observational data sets predict a negative cloud feedback, mainly driven by optical thickening. Between 45 degrees and 60 degrees S, the mean observed shortwave feedback (-0.91 0.82Wm(-2)K(-1), relative to local rather than global mean warming) is very close to the multimodel mean feedback in RCP8.5 (-0.98Wm(-2)K(-1)), despite differences in the meridional structure. In models, historical temperature-cloud property relationships reliably predict the forced RCP8.5 response. Because simple theory predicts this optical thickening with warming, and cloud amount changes are relatively small, we conclude that the shortwave cloud feedback is very likely negative in the real world at middle to high latitudes.",

abstract="Level 1 measurements, including cross-polarized backscatter, from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization lidar, have been used to document the vertical structure of the cloud thermodynamic phase at global scale. We built a cloud phase identification (liquid, ice, or undefined) in the Global Climate Model (GCM)-oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP) and analyzed the spatial distribution of liquid and ice clouds in five January, February, March (JFM) seasons of global-scale observations (2007-2011). We developed a cloud phase diagnosis in the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Program Observation Simulator Package to evaluate the cloud phase description in the LMDZ5B climate model. The diagnosis in the simulator is fully consistent with the CALIPSO-GOCCP observations to ensure that differences between the observations and the model+simulator ensemble outputs can be attributed to model biases. We compared the liquid and ice cloud vertical distributions simulated by the model with and without the simulator to quantify the impact of the simulator. The model does not produce liquid clouds above 3km and produces ice instead of liquid at low and middle altitudes in polar regions, as well as along the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The model is unable to replicate the observed coexistence of liquid and ice cloud between 0 degrees C and -40 degrees C. Liquid clouds dominate T>-21 degrees C in the observations, T>-12 degrees C in the model+simulator, and T>-7.5 degrees C in the model parameterization. Even if the simulator shifts the model cloud phase parameterization to colder temperature because of the lidar instrument peculiarities, the cloud phase transition remains too warm compared to the observations.",

abstract="We take advantage of climate simulations from two multimodel experiments to characterize and evaluate the cloud phase partitioning in 16 general circulation models (GCMs), specifically the vertical structure of the transition between liquid and ice in clouds. We base our analysis on the ratio of ice condensates to the total condensates (phase ratio, PR). Its transition at 90{\%} (PR90) and its links with other relevant variables are evaluated using the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation Cloud Product climatology, reanalysis data, and other satellite observations. In 13 of 16 models, the PR90 transition height occurs too low (6km to 8.4km) and at temperatures too warm (-13.9 degrees C to -32.5 degrees C) compared to observations (8.6km, -33.7 degrees C); features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with respect to ice above 6.5km. However, this bias would be slightly reduced by using the lidar simulator. In convective regimes (more humid air and precipitation), the observed cloud phase transition occurs at a warmer temperature than for subsidence regimes (less humid air and precipitation). Only few models manage to roughly replicate the observed correlations with humidity (5/16), vertical velocity (5/16), and precipitation (4/16); 3/16 perform well for all these parameters (MPI-ESM, NCAR-CAM5, and NCHU). Using an observation-based Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram, we illustrate that the Bergeron-Findeisen process is a necessary condition for models to represent the observed features. Finally, the best models are those that include more complex microphysics.",

High quantities of supercooled liquid water (up to 0.47gm(-3)) were observed in clouds as cold as -22 degrees C during two flights in different seasons and different meteorological conditions, supporting climatologies inferred from satellite observations. Cloud droplet concentrations were calculated from mean droplet size and liquid water concentrations, and were in the range of 30-120cm(-3), which is fairly typical for the pristine Southern Ocean environment. Ice in nonprecipitating or lightly precipitating clouds was found to be rare, while drizzle drops with diameter greater than 100m formed through warm rain processes were widespread.

pages="4605--4630",
abstract="Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from twentieth-century climate simulations by the newest generation of 18 coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include the mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal-to-interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM; version 2.3.2a), produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal, and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95\% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low latitudes, in contrast to 45\%-65\% in convective form in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to the unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local SST, which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Nino-3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage of the contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10-20 mm day(-1)), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (> 20 mm day(-1)) and overestimate them for light (< 10 mm day(-1)) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1-10 mm day(-1) category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America is comparable to that in the ITCZ (10-12 mm day(-1)) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in these new models and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of the world's coupled climate models.",

abstract="Global radiative feedbacks have been found to vary in global climate model (GCM) simulations. Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) driven with historical patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice concentrations produce radiative feedbacks that trend toward more negative values, implying low climate sensitivity, over recent decades. Freely evolving coupled GCMs driven by increasing CO2 produce radiative feedbacks that trend toward more positive values, implying increasing climate sensitivity, in the future. While this time variation in feedbacks has been linked to evolving SST patterns, the role of particular regions has not been quantified. Here, a Green's function is derived from a suite of simulations within an AGCM (NCAR's CAM4), allowing an attribution of global feedback changes to surface warming in each region. The results highlight the radiative response to surface warming in ascent regions of the western tropical Pacific as the dominant control on global radiative feedback changes. Historical warming from the 1950s to 2000s preferentially occurred in the western Pacific, yielding a strong global outgoing radiative response at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and thus a strongly negative global feedback. Long-term warming in coupled GCMs occurs preferentially in tropical descent regions and in high latitudes, where surface warming yields small global TOA radiation change but large global surface air temperature change, and thus a less-negative global feedback. These results illuminate the importance of determining mechanisms of warm pool warming for understanding how feedbacks have varied historically and will evolve in the future.",

Nevertheless, the contributions of the different radiative feedbacks to global warming (in equilibrium or transient conditions) and their comparison with the contribution of other processes (e.g., the ocean heat uptake) have not been quantified explicitly. Here these contributions from the classical feedback analysis framework are defined and quantified for an ensemble of 12 third Phase Of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3)/Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. In transient simulations, the multimodel mean contributions to global warming associated with the combined water vapor-lapse-rate feedback, cloud feedback, and ocean heat uptake are comparable. However, intermodel differences in cloud feedbacks constitute by far the most primary source of spread of both equilibrium and transient climate responses simulated by GCMs. The spread associated with intermodel differences in Cloud feedbacks appears to be roughly 3 times larger than that associated either with the combined water vapor-lapse-rate feedback, the ocean heat uptake, or the radiative forcing.",

abstract="The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP), an updated and enhanced version of the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) cloud liquid water path (CLWP) climatology, currently provides 29 years (1988-2016) of monthly gridded (1 degrees) oceanic CLWP information constructed using Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) intercalibrated 0.25 degrees-resolution retrievals. Satellite sources include SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, SSMIS, AMSR-2, and GMI. To mitigate spurious CLWP trends, the climatology is corrected for drifting satellite overpass times by simultaneously solving for the monthly average CLWP and the monthly mean diurnal cycle. In addition to a longer record and six additional satellite products, major enhancements relative to the UWisc climatology include updating the input to version 7 RSS retrievals, correcting for a CLWP bias (based on matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes), and constructing a total (cloud 1 rain) liquid water path (TLWP) record for use in analyses of columnar liquid water in raining clouds. Because the microwave emission signal from cloud water is similar to that of precipitation-sized hydrometeors, greater uncertainty in the CLWP record is expected in regions of substantial precipitation. Therefore, the TLWP field can also be used as a quality-control screen, where uncertainty increases as the ratio of CLWP to TLWP decreases. For regions where confidence in CLWP is highest (i.e., CLWP: TLWP > 0.8), systematic differences in MAC CLWP relative to UWisc CLWP range from -15{\%} (e.g., global oceanic stratocumulus decks) to +15{\%}-10{\%} (e.g., portions of the higher latitudes, storm tracks, and shallower convection regions straddling the ITCZ).

abstract="By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850-near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: - How does the Earth system respond to forcing? - What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? - How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.",

abstract="Global coupled climate models have large long-standing cloud and radiation biases, calling into question their ability to simulate climate and climate change. This study assesses the impact of reducing shortwave radiation biases on climate sensitivity within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The model is modified by increasing supercooled cloud liquid to better match absorbed shortwave radiation observations over the Southern Ocean while tuning to reduce a compensating tropical shortwave bias. With a thermodynamic mixed-layer ocean, equilibrium warming in response to doubled CO2 increases from 4.1 K in the control to 5.6 K in the modified model. This 1.5 K increase in equilibrium climate sensitivity is caused by changes in two extratropical shortwave cloud feedbacks. First, reduced conversion of cloud ice to liquid at high southern latitudes decreases the magnitude of a negative cloud phase feedback. Second, warming is amplified in the mid-latitudes by a larger positive shortwave cloud feedback. The positive cloud feedback, usually associated with the subtropics, arises when sea surface warming increases the moisture gradient between the boundary layer and free troposphere. The increased moisture gradient enhances the effectiveness of mixing to dry the boundary layer, which decreases cloud amount and optical depth. When a full-depth ocean with dynamics and thermodynamics is included, ocean heat uptake preferentially cools the mid-latitude Southern Ocean, partially inhibiting the positive cloud feedback and slowing warming. Overall, the results highlight strong connections between Southern Ocean mixed-phase cloud partitioning, cloud feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake in a climate forced by greenhouse gas changes.",

abstract="The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), initiated in 1989 under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme, undertook the systematic validation, diagnosis, and intercomparison of the performance of atmospheric general circulation models. For this purpose all models were required to simulate the evolution of the climate during the decade 1979-88, subject to the observed monthly average temperature and sea ice and a common prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar constant. By 1995, 31 modeling groups, representing virtually the entire international atmospheric modeling community, had contributed the required standard output of the monthly means of selected statistics. These data have been analyzed by the participating modeling groups, by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, and by the more than two dozen AMIP diagnostic subprojects that have been established to examine specific aspects of the models' performance. Here the analysis and validation of the AMIP results as a whole are summarized in order to document the overall performance of atmospheric general circulation-climate models as of the early 1990s. The infrastructure and plans for continuation of the AMIP project are also reported on. Although there are apparent model outliers in each simulated variable examined, validation of the AMIP models' ensemble mean shows that the average large-scale seasonal distributions of pressure, temperature, and circulation are reasonably close to what are believed to be the best observational estimates available. The large-scale structure of the ensemble mean precipitation and ocean surface heat flux also resemble the observed estimates but show particularly large intermodel differences in low latitudes. The total cloudiness, on the other hand, is rather poorly simulated, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The models' simulation of the seasonal cycle (as represented by the amplitude and phase of the first annual, harmonic of sea level pressure) closely resembles the observed variation in almost all regions. The ensemble's simulation of the interannual variability of sea level pressure in the tropical Pacific is reasonably close to that observed (except for its underestimate of the amplitude of major El Ninos), while the interannual variability is less well simulated in midlatitudes. When analyzed in terms of the variability of the evolution of their combined spacetime patterns in comparison to observations, the AMIP models are seen to exhibit a wide range of accuracy, with no single model performing best in all respects considered. Analysis of the subset of the original AMIP models for which revised versions have subsequently been used to revisit the experiment shows a substantial reduction of the models' systematic errors in simulating cloudiness but only a slight reduction of the mean seasonal errors of most other variables. In order to understand better the nature of these errors and to accelerate the rate of model improvement, an expanded and continuing project (AMIP II) is being undertaken in which analysis and intercomparison will address a wider range of variables and processes, using an improved diagnostic and experimental infrastructure.",

	Abstract = {Cloud microphysical process rates control the amount of condensed water in clouds and impact the susceptibility of precipitation to cloud-drop number and aerosols. The relative importance of different microphysical processes in a climate model is analyzed, and the autoconversion and accretion processes are found to be critical to the condensate budget in most regions. A simple steady-state model of warm rain formation is used to illustrate that the diagnostic rain formulations typical of climate models may result in excessive contributions from autoconversion, compared to observations and large eddy simulation models with explicit bin-resolved microphysics and rain formation processes. The behavior does not appear to be caused by the bulk process rate formulations themselves, because the steady-state model with the same bulk accretion and autoconversion has reduced contributions from autoconversion. Sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze how perturbations to the precipitation microphysics for stratiform clouds impact process rates, precipitation susceptibility and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). With similar liquid water path, corrections for the diagnostic rain assumptions in the GCM based on the steady-state model to boost accretion indicate that the radiative effects of ACI may decrease by 20\% in the GCM. Links between process rates, susceptibility and ACI are not always clear in the GCM. Better representation of the precipitation process, for example by prognosticating precipitation mass and number, may help better constrain these effects in global models with bulk microphysics schemes.},

	Abstract = {A modified microphysics scheme is implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5). The new scheme features prognostic precipitation. The coupling between the microphysics and the rest of the model is modified to make it more flexible. Single-column tests show the new microphysics can simulate a constrained drizzling stratocumulus case. Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to significantly reduce aerosol cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33\% (depending on substepping) to below 1 W m(-2) of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions.},

	Abstract = {Aerosols can influence cloud radiative effects and, thus, may alter interpretation of how Earth's radiative budget responds to climate forcing. Three different ensemble experiments from the same climate model with different greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios are used to analyze the role of aerosols in climate feedbacks and their spread across initial condition ensembles of transient climate simulations. The standard deviation of global feedback parameters across ensemble members is low, typically 0.02 W m(-2) K-1. Feedbacks from high (8.5 W m(-2)) and moderate (4.5 W m(-2)) year 2100 forcing cases are nearly identical. An aerosol kernel is introduced to remove effects of aerosol cloud interactions that alias into cloud feedbacks. Adjusted cloud feedbacks indicate an ``aerosol feedback'' resulting from changes to climate that increase sea-salt emissions, mostly in the Southern Ocean. Ensemble simulations also indicate higher tropical cloud feedbacks with higher aerosol loading. These effects contribute to a difference in cloud feedbacks of nearly 50\% between ensembles of the same model. These two effects are also seen in aquaplanet simulations with varying fixed drop number. Thus aerosols can be a significant modifier of cloud feedbacks, and different representations of aerosols and their interactions with clouds may contribute to multimodel spread in climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity in multimodel archives.},

	Abstract = {Most estimates of the global mean indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosol on the Earth's energy balance are from simulations by global models of the aerosol lifecycle coupled with global models of clouds and the hydrologic cycle. Extremely simple models have been developed for integrated assessment models, but lack the flexibility to distinguish between primary and secondary sources of aerosol. Here a simple but more physically based model expresses the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) using analytic representations of cloud and aerosol distributions and processes. Although the simple model is able to produce estimates of AIEs that are comparable to those from some global aerosol models using the same global mean aerosol properties, the estimates by the simple model are sensitive to preindustrial cloud condensation nuclei concentration, preindustrial accumulation mode radius, width of the accumulation mode, size of primary particles, cloud thickness, primary and secondary anthropogenic emissions, the fraction of the secondary anthropogenic emissions that accumulates on the coarse mode, the fraction of the secondary mass that forms new particles, and the sensitivity of liquid water path to droplet number concentration. Estimates of present-day AIEs as low as -5 W m(-2) and as high as -0.3 W m(-2) are obtained for plausible sets of parameter values. Estimates are surprisingly linear in emissions. The estimates depend on parameter values in ways that are consistent with results from detailed global aerosol-climate simulation models, which adds to understanding of the dependence on AIE uncertainty on uncertainty in parameter values.},

	Abstract = {A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the relationships between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and emissions, droplet number and CCN concentration, cloud fraction and droplet number, cloud optical depth and droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing and cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the relationship of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path with droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of these quantities. However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. Our analysis of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) model simulations suggests that estimates of relationships from recent variability are poor constraints on relationships from anthropogenic change for some terms, with even the sign of some relationships differing in many regions. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.},

abstract="The strength of the effective anthropogenic climate forcing from aerosol cloud interactions is related to the susceptibility of precipitation to aerosol effects. Precipitation susceptibility dlnP/dlnN has been proposed as a metric to quantify the effect of aerosol-induced changes in cloud droplet number N on warm precipitation rate P. Based on the microphysical rate equations of the Seifert and Beheng two-moment bulk microphysics scheme, susceptibilities of warm-, mixed-, and ice-phase precipitation and cirrus sedimentation to cloud droplet and ice crystal number are estimated. The estimation accounts for microphysical adjustments to the initial perturbation in N. For warm rain, dlnP/dlnN < -2aut/(aut + acc) is found, which depends on the rates of autoconversion (aut) and accretion (acc). Cirrus sedimentation susceptibility corresponds to the exponent of crystal sedimentation velocity with a value of -0.2. For mixed-phase clouds, several microphysical contributions that explain low precipitation susceptibilities are identified: (i) Because of the larger hydrometeor sizes involved, mixed-phase collection processes are less sensitive to changes in hydrometeor size than auto conversion. (ii) Only a subset of precipitation formation processes is sensitive to droplet or crystal number. (iii) Effects on collection processes and diffusional growth compensate. (iv) Adjustments in cloud liquid and ice amount compensate the effect of changes in ice crystal and cloud droplet number. (v) Aerosol perturbations that simultaneously affect ice crystal and droplet number have opposing effects.",

	Abstract = {The recently developed GFDL Atmospheric Model version 3 (AM3), an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), incorporates a prognostic treatment of cloud drop number to simulate the aerosol indirect effect. Since cloud drop activation depends on cloud-scale vertical velocities, which are not reproduced in present-day GCMs, additional assumptions on the subgrid variability are required to implement a local activation parameterization into a GCM. This paper describes the subgrid activation assumptions in AM3 and explores sensitivities by constructing alternate configurations. These alternate model configurations exhibit only small differences in their present-day climatology. However, the total anthropogenic radiative flux perturbation (RFP) between present-day and preindustrial conditions varies by +/- 50\% from the reference, because of a large difference in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect. The spread in RFP does not originate directly from the subgrid assumptions but indirectly through the cloud retuning necessary to maintain a realistic radiation balance. In particular, the paper shows a linear correlation between the choice of autoconversion threshold radius and the RFP. Climate sensitivity changes only minimally between the reference and alternate configurations. If implemented in a fully coupled model, these alternate configurations would therefore likely produce substantially different warming from preindustrial to present day.},

abstract="The relationship between low-level cloud optical depth and atmospheric and surface air temperature is examined in the control climate of 13 climate models to determine if cloud optical depth-temperature relationships found in observations are replicated in climate models and if climate model behavior found in control climate simulations provides information about the optical depth feedback in climate warming simulations forced by increasing carbon dioxide. A positive relationship between cloud optical depth and cloud temperature exists in all models for low clouds with relatively cold temperatures at middle and high latitudes, whereas a negative relationship exists for warmer low clouds in the tropics and subtropics. This relationship is qualitatively similar to that in an earlier analysis of satellite observations, although modeled regression slopes tend to be too positive and their intermodel spread is large. In the models, the cold cloud response comes from increases in cloud water content with increasing temperature, while the warm cloud response comes from decreases in physical thickness with increasing cloud temperature. The intermodel and interregional spread of low-cloud optical depth feedback in climate warming simulations is well predicted by the corresponding spread in the relationships between optical depth and temperature for the current climate, suggesting that this aspect of cloud feedback may be constrained by observations. Because models have a positive bias relative to observations in the optical depth-temperature relationship, shortwave cloud feedback for climate changes may be more positive than climate models currently simulate.",

	Abstract = {Much of the uncertainty in estimates of the anthropogenic forcing of climate change comes from uncertainties in the instantaneous effect of aerosols on cloud albedo, known as the Twomey effect or the radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci), a component of the total or effective radiative forcing. Because aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei can have a strong influence on the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), previous studies have used the sensitivity of the Nd to aerosol properties as a constraint on the strength of the RFaci. However, recent studies have suggested that relationships between aerosol and cloud properties in the present-day climate may not be suitable for determining the sensitivity of the Nd to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations. Using an ensemble of global aerosol-climate models, this study demonstrates how joint histograms between Nd and aerosol properties can account for many of the issues raised by previous studies. It shows that if the anthropogenic contribution to the aerosol is known, the RFaci can be diagnosed to within 20\% of its actual value. The accuracy of different aerosol proxies for diagnosing the RFaci is investigated, confirming that using the aerosol optical depth significantly underestimates the strength of the aerosol-cloud interactions in satellite data.},

abstract="The impact of aerosols on cloud properties is one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate. Significant progress has been made in constraining this forcing using observations, but uncertainty remains, particularly in the magnitude of cloud rapid adjustments to aerosol perturbations. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is the leading control on liquid-cloud albedo, making it important to observationally constrain the aerosol impact on LWP. Previous modelling and observational studies have shown that multiple processes play a role in determining the LWP response to aerosol perturbations, but that the aerosol effect can be difficult to isolate. Following previous studies using mediating variables, this work investigates use of the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) and LWP for constraining the role of aerosols. Using joint-probability histograms to account for the non-linear relationship, this work finds a relationship that is broadly consistent with previous studies. There is significant geographical variation in the relationship, partly due to role of meteorological factors (particularly relative humidity). The N-d-LWP relationship is negative in the majority of regions, suggesting that aerosol-induced LWP reductions could offset a significant fraction of the instantaneous radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci). However, variations in the N-d-LWP relationship in response to volcanic and shipping aerosol perturbations indicate that the N-d-LWP relationship overestimates the causal N-d impact on LWP due to the role of confounding factors. The weaker LWP reduction implied by these ``natural experiments'' means that this work provides an upper bound to the radiative forcing from aerosol-induced changes in the LWP.",

   investigate the influence of entrainment and mixing on aerosol-cloud
   interactions in the context of idealized, nocturnal, nondrizzling marine
   stratocumulus (Sc). Of particular interest are (i) an
   evaporation-entrainment effect and a sedimentation-entrainment effect
   that result from increasing aerosol concentrations and (ii) the nature
   of mixing between clear and cloudy air, where homogeneous and extreme
   inhomogeneous mixing represent the bounding mixing types. Simulations
   are performed at low resolution (Delta z = 20 m; Delta x, y = 40 m) and
   high resolution (Delta z = 10 m; Delta x, y = 20 m). It is demonstrated
   that an increase in aerosol from clean conditions (100 cm(-3)) to
   polluted conditions (1000 cm(-3)) produces both an
   evaporation-entrainment and a sedimentation-entrainment effect, which
   couple to cause about a 10\% decrease in liquid water path (LWP) when
   all warm microphysical processes are included. These dynamical effects
   are insensitive to both the resolutions tested and the mixing
   assumption. Regardless of resolution, assuming extreme inhomogeneous
   rather than homogeneous mixing results in a small reduction in
   cloud-averaged drop number concentration, a small increase in cloud drop
   effective radius, and; 1\% decrease in cloud optical depth. For the case
   presented, these small changes play a negligible role when compared to
   the impact of increasing aerosol and the associated entrainment effects.
   Finally, it is demonstrated that although increasing resolution causes
   an increase in LWP and number concentration, the relative sensitivity of
   cloud optical depth to changes in aerosol is unaffected by resolution.},

In general, less aerosol is scavenged into clouds with the new prognostic treatment than what is prescribed in standard ECHAM5-HAM. Aerosol concentrations, size distributions, scavenged fractions and cloud droplet concentrations are evaluated and compared to different observations. While the scavenged fraction and the aerosol number concentrations in the marine boundary layer are well represented in the new model, aerosol optical thickness, cloud droplet number concentrations in the marine boundary layer and the aerosol volume in the accumulation and coarse modes over the oceans are overestimated. Sensitivity studies suggest that a better representation of below-cloud scavenging, higher in-cloud collision coefficients, or a reduced water uptake by seasalt aerosols could reduce these biases.",

abstract="The collective representation within global models of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and their radiative properties remains unsatisfactory. They constitute the largest source of uncertainty in predictions of climatic change and hamper the ability of numerical weather prediction models to forecast high-impact weather events. The joint European Space Agency (ESA)-Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, will help to resolve these weaknesses by providing global profiles of cloud, aerosol, precipitation, and associated radiative properties inferred from a combination of measurements made by its collocated active and passive sensors. EarthCARE will improve our understanding of cloud and aerosol processes by extending the invaluable dataset acquired by the A-Train satellites CloudSat, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and Aqua. Specifically, EarthCARE's cloud profiling radar, with 7 dB more sensitivity than CloudSat, will detect more thin clouds and its Doppler capability will provide novel information on convection, precipitating ice particle, and raindrop fall speeds. EarthCARE's 355-nm high-spectral-resolution lidar will measure directly and accurately cloud and aerosol extinction and optical depth. Combining this with backscatter and polarization information should lead to an unprecedented ability to identify aerosol type. The multispectral imager will provide a context for, and the ability to construct, the cloud and aerosol distribution in 3D domains around the narrow 2D retrieved cross section. The consistency of the retrievals will be assessed to within a target of +/- 10 W m(-2) on the (10 km)(2) scale by comparing the multiview broadband radiometer observations to the top-of-atmosphere fluxes estimated by 3D radiative transfer models acting on retrieved 3D domains.",

abstract="Global climate models (GCMs) have been found to share the common too-frequent bias in the warm rain formation process. In this study, five different autoconversion schemes are incorporated into a single GCM, to systematically evaluate the warm rain formation processes in comparison with satellite observations and investigate their effects on the aerosol indirect effect (AIE). It is found that some schemes generate warm rain less efficiently under polluted conditions in the manner closer to satellite observations, while the others generate warm rain too frequently. Large differences in AIE are found among these schemes. It is remarkable that the schemes with more observation-like warm rain formation processes exhibit larger AIEs that far exceed the uncertainty range reported in IPCC AR5, to an extent that can cancel much of the warming trend in the past century, whereas schemes with too-frequent rain formations yield AIEs that are well bounded by the reported range. The power-law dependence of the autoconversion rate on the cloud droplet number concentration beta is found to affect substantially the susceptibility of rain formation to aerosols: the more negative beta is, the more difficult it is for rain to be triggered in polluted clouds, leading to larger AIE through substantial contributions from the wet scavenging feedback. The appropriate use of a droplet size threshold can mitigate the effect of a less negative beta. The role of the warm rain formation process on AIE in this particular model has broad implications for others that share the too-frequent rain-formation bias.",

By embedding a lidar simulator within CAM5, the idiosyncrasies of spaceborne lidar cloud detection and phase assignment are replicated. As a result, this study makes scale-aware and definition-aware comparisons between model-simulated and observed cloud amount and cloud phase. In the global mean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud and excessive ice cloud when compared to CALIPSO observations. Over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, CAM5 has insufficient liquid cloud in all seasons. Having important implications for projections of future sea level rise, a liquid cloud deficit contributes to a cold bias of 2-3 degrees C for summer daily maximum near-surface air temperatures at Summit, Greenland. Over themidlatitude stormtracks, CAM5 has excessive ice cloud and insufficient liquid cloud. Storm track cloud phase biases in CAM5 maximize over the Southern Ocean, which also has larger-than-observed seasonal variations in cloud phase. Physical parameter modifications reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint. The results also highlight the importance of using a regime-based, as opposed to a geographic-based, model evaluation approach. More generally, the results demonstrate the importance and value of simulator-enabled comparisons of cloud phase in models used for future climate projection.",

abstract="CloudSat's 94-GHz Cloud Profiling Radar provides unique near-global observations of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here CloudSat-based diagnostics for near-surface precipitation frequency are implemented in publicly available software that is widely used for climate model evaluation. The new diagnostics are definition aware and scale aware. As a result, the diagnostics enable robust assessment of modeled near-surface precipitation frequency at a range of intensity classes. The new diagnostics are used to evaluate precipitation frequency in a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). CESM1 rains and snows too frequently, a bias that is especially pronounced for light rain. Conversely, while rare in both observations and CESM1, the heaviest rainfall events occur too infrequently in CESM1. Though the spatial distribution of snowfall events matches observations well, CESM1 also exhibits excessive snow frequency biases. Despite these biases, projected CESM1 changes in reflectivity-based diagnostics provide interesting insights into what a future 94-GHz radar could detect in a warmer world. With 3 degrees C of global warming, a future CloudSat-class mission would detect substantial conversion of snow to rain at midlatitudes, a narrowing of the Tropical Pacific rain belt, increased light rain in subtropics, and increased snow frequency in polar regions. The future CESM1 simulations also provide evidence that present-day spatial and magnitude biases imprint themselves on precipitation frequency changes. In summary, new precipitation frequency diagnostics for a range of precipitation intensities robustly expose climate model biases and inform expectations for observable future precipitation changes in a warming world.",

abstract="Mixed-phase clouds (clouds that consist of both cloud droplets and ice crystals) are frequently present in the Earth's atmosphere and influence the Earth's energy budget through their radiative properties, which are highly dependent on the cloud water phase. In this study, the phase partitioning of cloud water is compared among six global climate models (GCMs) and with Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization retrievals. It is found that the GCMs predict vastly different distributions of cloud phase for a given temperature, and none of them are capable of reproducing the spatial distribution or magnitude of the observed phase partitioning. While some GCMs produced liquid water paths comparable to satellite observations, they all failed to preserve sufficient liquid water at mixed-phase cloud temperatures. Our results suggest that validating GCMs using only the vertically integrated water contents could lead to amplified differences in cloud radiative feedback. The sensitivity of the simulated cloud phase in GCMs to the choice of heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization is also investigated. The response to a change in ice nucleation is quite different for each GCM, and the implementation of the same ice nucleation parameterization in all models does not reduce the spread in simulated phase among GCMs. The results suggest that processes subsequent to ice nucleation are at least as important in determining phase and should be the focus of future studies aimed at understanding and reducing differences among the models.",

abstract="Deficiencies in the parameterizations of convection used in global climate models often lead to a distorted representation of the simulated rainfall intensity distribution (i.e., too much rainfall from weak rain rates). While encouraging improvements in high percentile rainfall intensity have been found as the horizontal resolution of the Community Atmosphere Model is increased to similar to 25 km, we demonstrate no corresponding improvement in the moderate rain rates that generate the majority of accumulated rainfall. Using a statistical framework designed to emphasize links between precipitation intensity and accumulated rainfall beyond just the frequency distribution, we show that CAM cannot realistically simulate moderate rain rates, and cannot capture their intensification with climate change, even as resolution is increased. However, by separating the parameterized convective and large-scale resolved contributions to total rainfall, we find that the intensity, geographic pattern, and climate change response of CAM's large-scale rain rates are more consistent with observations (TRMM 3B42), superparameterization, and theoretical expectations, despite issues with parameterized convection. Increasing CAM's horizontal resolution does improve the representation of total rainfall intensity, but not due to changes in the intensity of large-scale rain rates, which are surprisingly insensitive to horizontal resolution. Rather, improvements occur through an increase in the relative contribution of the large-scale component to the total amount of accumulated rainfall. Analysis of sensitivities to convective timescale and entrainment rate confirm the importance of these parameters in the possible development of scale-aware parameterizations, but also reveal unrecognized trade-offs from the entanglement of precipitation frequency and total amount.",

	Abstract = {Climate models continue to exhibit strong sensitivity to the representation of aerosol effects on cloud reflectance and cloud amount. This paper evaluates a proposed method to constrain modeled cloud liquid water path (LWP) adjustments in response to changes in aerosol concentration N-a using observations of precipitation susceptibility. Recent climate modeling has suggested a linear relationship between relative LWP responses to relative changes in N-a, i.e., dlnLWP/dln N-a, and the precipitation frequency susceptibility S-pop, which is defined as the relative change in the probability of precipitation for a relative change in N-a. Using large-eddy simulations (LES) of marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds, we show that these two cloud regimes exhibit qualitatively different relationships between lambda and S-pop; in stratocumulus clouds, lambda increases with S-pop, while in trade wind cumulus, lambda decreases with S-pop. The LES-derived relationship for marine stratocumulus is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different than that derived from climate model simulations of oceanic clouds aggregated over much larger spatial scales. We explore possible reasons for variability in these relationships, including the selected precipitation threshold and the various definitions of precipitation susceptibility that are currently in use. Because aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are inherently small-scale processes, we recommend that when deriving the relationship between lambda and S-pop, careful attention be given to the cloud regime, the scale, and the extent of aggregation of the model output or the observed data.},

The proposed framework indicates a mean bias in autoconversion rates of 129\% when subgrid scale cloud water variability is neglected and bias in accretion rates of 60\% when subgrid cloud-precipitation covariability is neglected at a model grid resolution of 141km. The bias in accretion rate is dependent on the significant correlation () found between cloud and precipitation, which in the global mean is found to be =0.44. The regional distribution of the process rate biases is largely governed by the spatial pattern of cloud water variance. Specific areas of low cloud water variance are found in the subtropical eastern ocean basins and the high latitudes, whereas much of the tropics display relatively larger cloud water variance. These regional distinctions in cloud water variance are associated with commensurate regionality in the process rate biases. The magnitude of the bias has a scale dependence that is governed by the spatial scaling behavior of the cloud and precipitation variances, which follow a power law scaling with exponent of 2/3 at scales below about 10km and decreasing exponent above this length scale. While the parametric framework reduces biases in the accretion rate estimated from the grid-mean values of cloud and precipitation water, it is shown that it still undercorrects the accretion rate because it neglects the fact that the precipitation fractional area is less than the cloud fractional area and is preferentially colocated with the highest cloud water concentrations. These results imply that (1) predicting the appropriate balance of autoconversion to accretion in global models requires not only the subgrid scale cloud water variability but also the subgrid scale covariability of cloud and precipitation water and (2) the ability of a global model to calculate the correct regional variation in process rates depends crucially on the fidelity of that model to predict or diagnose the spatial distribution of the variance in cloud water.",

abstract="We perform an observationally based evaluation of the cloud ice water content (CIWC) and path (CIWP) of present-day GCMs, notably 20th century CMIP5 simulations, and compare these results to CMIP3 and two recent reanalyses. We use three different CloudSat + CALIPSO ice water products and two methods to remove the contribution from the convective core ice mass and/or precipitating cloud hydrometeors with variable sizes and falling speeds so that a robust observational estimate can be obtained for model evaluations. The results show that for annual mean CIWP, there are factors of 2-10 in the differences between observations and models for a majority of the GCMs and for a number of regions. However, there are a number of CMIP5 models, including CNRM-CM5, MRI, CCSM4 and CanESM2, as well as the UCLA CGCM, that perform well compared to our past evaluations. Systematic biases in CIWC vertical structure occur below the mid-troposphere where the models overestimate CIWC, with this bias arising mostly from the extratropics. The tropics are marked by model differences in the level of maximum CIWC (similar to 250-550 hPa). Based on a number of metrics, the ensemble behavior of CMIP5 has improved considerably relative to CMIP3, although neither the CMIP5 ensemble mean nor any individual model performs particularly well, and there are still a number of models that exhibit very large biases despite the availability of relevant observations. The implications of these results on model representations of the Earth radiation balance are discussed, along with caveats and uncertainties associated with the observational estimates, model and observation representations of the precipitating and cloudy ice components, relevant physical processes and parameterizations.",

A new Kessler-type parameterization is further derived by eliminating the incorrect and/or unnecessary assumptions inherent in the existing Kessler-type parameterizations. The new parameterization exhibits a different dependence on liquid water content and droplet concentration, and provides theoretical explanations for the multitude of values assigned to the tunable coefficients associated with the commonly used parameterizations. Relative dispersion of the cloud droplet size distribution (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean radius of the cloud droplet size distribution) is explicitly included in the new parameterization, allowing for investigation of the influences of the relative dispersion on the autoconversion rate and, hence, on the second indirect aerosol effect.

A one-time adjustment to shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA fluxes is made to ensure that global mean net TOA flux for July 2005-June 2015 is consistent with the in situ value of 0.71 W m(-2). While global mean all-sky TOA flux differences between Ed4.0 and Ed2.8 are within 0.5 W m(-2), appreciable SW regional differences occur over marine stratocumulus and snow/sea ice regions. Marked regional differences in SW clear-sky TOA flux occur in polar regions and dust areas over ocean. Clear-sky LW TOA fluxes in EBAF Ed4.0 exceed Ed2.8 in regions of persistent high cloud cover. Owing to substantial differences in global mean clear-sky TOA fluxes, the net cloud radiative effect in EBAF Ed4.0 is -18 W m(-2) compared to -21 W m(-2) in EBAF Ed2.8. The overall uncertainty in 18 3 18 latitude-longitude regional monthly all-sky TOA flux is estimated to be 3 W m(-2) [one standard deviation (1 sigma)] for the Terra-only period and 2.5 W m(-2) for the Terra-Aqua period both for SW and LW fluxes.

abstract="A coupled sulfur chemistry-cloud microphysics scheme (COUPL) is used to study the impact of sulfate aerosols on cloud lifetime and albedo. The cloud microphysics scheme includes precipitation formation, which depends on the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and on the liquid water content. On the basis of different observational data sets, CDNC is proportional to the sulfate aerosol mass, which is calculated by the model. Cloud cover is a function of relative humidity only. Additional sensitivity experiments with another cloud cover parameterization (COUPL-CC), which also depends on cloud water, and with a different autoconversion rate of cloud droplets (COUPL-CC-Aut) are conducted to investigate the range of the indirect effect due to uncertainties in cloud physics. For each experiment, two simulations, one using present-day and one using preindustrial sulfur emissions are carried out. The increase in liquid water path, cloud cover, and shortwave cloud forcing due to anthropogenic sulfur emissions depends crucially upon the parameterization of cloud cover and autoconversion of cloud droplets. In COUPL the liquid water path increases by 17\% and cloud cover increases by 1\% because of anthropogenic sulfur emissions, yielding an increase in shortwave cloud forcing of -1.4 W m(-2). In COUPL-CC the liquid water path increases by 32\%, cloud cover increases by 3\% and thus shortwave cloud forcing increases by -4.8 W m(-2). This large effect is caused by the strong dependence of cloud cover on cloud water and of the autoconversion rate on CDNC, cloud water, and cloud cover. Choosing a different autoconversion rate (COUPL-CC-Aut) with a reduced dependence on CDNC and cloud water results in an increase of liquid water path by only 11\% and of cloud cover by 1\%, and the increase in shortwave cloud forcing amounts to -2.2 W m(-2). These results clearly show that the uncertainties linked to the indirect aerosol effect are higher than was previously suggested.",

abstract="Assessments of the influence of aerosol emissions from human activities on the radiation budget, in particular via the modification of cloud properties, have been a challenge. In light of the variability to both aerosol properties and environmental properties affected by aerosols, observational evidence alone cannot provide accurate and global answers, because detailed observations are locally limited and/or lack statistical significance. Thus, current understanding is predominantly derived from simulations with global models. General discrepancies to envelope (backward) modeling, however, suggest that many aerosol processes in global (forward) modeling are not properly considered. Using analytically derived parameterizations is recommended wherever possible. If an analytical method does not exist or is too demanding computationally, laboratory results augmented by field data are the second-best approach. For the constraint of so-derived parameterizations at the GCM scale, evaluating individual parameterizations using statistical relationships of satellite-retrieved quantities relevant to the process is recommended. The set of parameterizations may also be evaluated and improved using the data assimilation technique. To improve the quality of data references to modeling, there is a need to link available atmospheric data from all scales, and establish and support validation networks and experiments, and a commitment to fine-tune and improve satellite retrievals in an iterative process even beyond the anticipated period of the mission. Only then can more reliable estimates of the indirect aerosol effect be expected.",

abstract="Clouds constitute a large uncertainty in global climate modeling and climate change projections as many clouds are smaller than the size of a model grid box. Some processes, such as the rates of rain and snow formation that have a large impact on climate, cannot be observed. The uncertain parameters in the representation of these processes are therefore adjusted in order to achieve radiation balance. Here we systematically investigate the impact of key tunable parameters within the convective and stratiform cloud schemes and of the ice cloud optical properties on the present-day climate in terms of clouds, radiation and precipitation. The total anthropogenic aerosol effect between pre-industrial and present-day times amounts to -1.00 W m(-2) obtained as an average over all simulations as compared to -1.02 W m(-2) from those simulations where the global annual mean top-of-the atmosphere radiation balance is within -1.02 W m(-2). Thus tuning of the present-day climate does not seem to have an influence on the total anthropogenic aerosol effect. The parametric uncertainty regarding the above mentioned cloud parameters has an uncertainty range of 25\% between the minimum and maximum value when taking all simulations into account. It is reduced to 11\% when only the simulations with a balanced top-of-the atmosphere radiation are considered.",

abstract="How clouds change in a warmer climate remains one of the largest uncertainties for the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). While a large spread in the cloud feedback arises from low-level clouds, it was recently shown that mixed-phase clouds are also important for ECS. If mixed-phase clouds in the current climate contain too few supercooled cloud droplets, too much ice will change to liquid water in a warmer climate. As shown by Tan et al. (2016), this overestimates the negative cloud-phase feedback and underestimates ECS in the CAM global climate model (GCM). Here we use the newest version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM to investigate the importance of mixed-phase and ice clouds for ECS. Although we also considerably underestimate the fraction of supercooled liquid water globally in the reference version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM, we do not obtain increases in ECS in simulations with more supercooled liquid water in the present-day climate, different from the findings by Tan et al. (2016). We hypothesize that it is not the global supercooled liquid water fraction that matters, but only how well low-and mid-level mixed-phase clouds with cloud-top temperatures in the mixed-phase temperature range between 0 and -35 degrees C that are not shielded by higher-lying ice clouds are simulated. These occur most frequently in midlatitudes, in particular over the Southern Ocean where they determine the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation. In ECHAM6-HAM2 the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean is only significantly overestimated if all clouds below 0 degrees C consist exclusively of ice. Only in this simulation is ECS significantly smaller than in all other simulations and the cloud optical depth feedback is the dominant cloud feedback. In all other simulations, the cloud optical depth feedback is weak and changes in cloud feedbacks associated with cloud amount and cloud-top pressure dominate the overall cloud feedback. However, apart from the simulation with only ice below 0 degrees C, differences in the overall cloud feedback are not translated into differences in ECS in our model. This insensitivity to the cloud feedback in our model is explained with compensating effects in the clear sky.",

abstract="Aerosol-cloud interactions remain a major uncertainty in climate research. Studies have indicated that model estimates of cloud susceptibility to aerosols frequently exceed satellite estimates, motivating model reformulations to increase agreement. Here we show that conventional ways of using satellite information to estimate susceptibility can serve as only a weak constraint on models because the estimation is sensitive to errors in the retrieval procedures. Using instrument simulators to investigate differences between model and satellite estimates of susceptibilities, we find that low aerosol loading conditions are not well characterized by satellites, but model clouds are sensitive to aerosol perturbations in these conditions. We quantify the observational requirements needed to constrain models, and find that the nighttime lidar measurements of aerosols provide a better characterization of tenuous aerosols. We conclude that observational uncertainties and limitations need to be accounted for when assessing the role of aerosols in the climate system.",

We find that cloud cover during CAPRICORN was 76{\%}, dominated by clouds based in the marine boundary layer. This was lower than comparable measurements collected by CC during these months, although the CC dataset observed significantly more high clouds. In the surface-based data, approximately 2/3 (1/2) of all low-level layers observed had a reflectivity below -20 dBZ in the CAPRICORN data (GRW) with 30{\%} (20{\%}) of the layers observed only by the lidar.

Based on the findings presented in a companion paper (Part I), we focus our attention on a subset of marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds that form a substantial portion of the cloud-coverage fraction. We find that the MBL clouds that dominate the coverage fraction tend to occur in decoupled boundary layers near the base of marine inversions. The thermodynamic conditions under which these clouds are found are reminiscent of marine stratocumulus studied extensively in the subtropical eastern ocean basins except that here they are often supercooled with a rare presence of the ice phase, quite tenuous in terms of their physical properties, rarely drizzling, and tend to occur in migratory high pressure systems in cold-air advection. We develop a simple cloud property retrieval algorithm that uses as input the lidar-attenuated backscatter, the W-band radar reflectivity, and the 31-GHz brightness temperature. We find that the stratocumulus clouds examined have water paths in the 15-25 g m(-2) range, effective radii near 8 m, and number concentrations in the 20 cm(-3) range in the Southern Ocean with optical depths in the range of 3-4. We speculate that addressing the high bias in absorbed shortwave radiation in climate models will require understanding the processes that form and maintain these marine stratocumulus clouds in southern mid- and high latitudes.",

Using data from the CALIPSO lidar, we reconsider the thresholds of layer-integrated depolarization ratio and layer-integrated attenuated backscatter that are used to diagnose the phases of fully attenuating cloud layers. We argue that liquid-only clouds have understood physical bounds to these thresholds allowing for unique identification of layers that are not consistent with the presence of single-phase liquid tops. Compared to the original phase algorithm the application of these physically constrained thresholds results in a similar to 70{\%} increase in mixed phase during the annual cycle considered.

Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols; these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify aerosol-cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014-2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud droplets-consistent with expectations-but had no discernible effect on other cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and global-mean radiative forcing of around -0.2 watts per square metre for September to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however, were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.",

abstract="An emerging literature suggests that estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) derived from recent observations and energy balance models are biased low because models project more positive climate feedback in the far future. Here we use simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to show that across models, ECS inferred from the recent historical period (1979-2005) is indeed almost uniformly lower than that inferred from simulations subject to abrupt increases in CO2 radiative forcing. However, ECS inferred from simulations in which sea surface temperatures are prescribed according to observations is lower still. ECS inferred from simulations with prescribed sea surface temperatures is strongly linked to changes to tropical marine low clouds. However, feedbacks from these clouds are a weak constraint on long-term model ECS. One interpretation is that observations of recent climate changes constitute a poor direct proxy for long-term sensitivity. Plain Language Summary Even if we remove the uncertainty associated with human behavior, we still don't know exactly how hot it is going to get. This is because warming associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide triggers climate changes that themselves can accelerate or decelerate the warming. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is defined as the eventual warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, and it is tempting to estimate this quantity from recent observations. However, in climate models, the ECS inferred from recent decades is lower than the eventual warming for two reasons. First, it takes the climate many centuries to fully come to equilibrium, and models indicate that we should expect even more warming in the future. Second, the conditions experienced in the real world seem to have given rise to especially low estimates of ECS, perhaps purely by chance. Climate models indicate that not only are ECS estimates based on recent decades lower than the eventual warming, but they may not even be predictive of that warming. A climate model that shows strong warming in response to recent real-world conditions does not necessarily have high long-term sensitivity, and vice versa.",

These desired properties are observables, such as the radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere, the global mean temperature, sea ice, clouds and wind fields. The tuning is typically performed by adjusting uncertain, or even non-observable, parameters related to processes not explicitly represented at the model grid resolution. The practice of climate model tuning has seen an increasing level of attention because key model properties, such as climate sensitivity, have been shown to depend on frequently used tuning parameters. Here we provide insights into how climate model tuning is practically done in the case of closing the radiation balance and adjusting the global mean temperature for the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model. The impacts of parameter tuning on climate sensitivity was less than anticipated.},

abstract="A likely important feature of the poorly understood aerosol-cloud interactions over the Southern Ocean (SO) is the dominant role of sea spray aerosol, versus terrestrial aerosol. Ice nucleating particles (INPs), or particles required for heterogeneous ice nucleation, present over the SO have not been studied in several decades. In this study, boundary layer aerosol properties and immersion freezing INP number concentrations (n(INPs)) were measured during a ship campaign that occurred south of Australia (down to 53 degrees S) in March-April 2016. Ocean surface chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 1.77 mg/m(3), and nINPs were a factor of 100 lower than historical surveys, ranging from 0.38 to 4.6 m(-3) at -20 degrees C. The INP population included organic heat-stable material, with contributions from heat-labile material. Lower INP source potentials of SO seawater samples compared to Arctic seawater were consistent with lower ice nucleating site densities in this study compared to north Atlantic air masses. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean is known for a prevalence of clouds that contain both liquid and ice, which are one of the most poorly understood cloud regimes in the climate system. A large gap in understanding important processes in these clouds is a lack of knowledge regarding particles (e.g., sea spray) required for forming ice crystals, termed ice nucleating particles. In a ship-based monthlong field study, several instruments were deployed in efforts to characterize the ice nucleating particles present over the Southern Ocean for the first time in over four decades. Abundances of ice nucleating particles throughout the voyage were extremely low compared to other ocean regions, and concentrations were 2 orders of magnitude lower than the most recent survey conducted in the 1970s. We report that the ocea-derived ice nucleating particles observed in this study were organic in nature, supporting a hypothesized link between ice nucleating particles and organic particles associated with phytoplankton blooms. The data from this study provide a desperately needed benchmark for constraining the number of ice crystals that may form in the remote and poorly understood clouds occurring over the Southern Ocean.",

abstract="The sensitivity of the reflection of shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean to the cloud properties there is estimated using observations from a suite of passive and active satellite instruments in combination with radiative transfer modeling. A composite cloud property observational data description is constructed that consistently incorporates mean cloud liquid water content, ice water content, liquid and ice particle radius information, vertical structure, vertical overlap, and spatial aggregation of cloud water as measured by optical depth versus cloud-top pressure histograms. The observational datasets used are Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) effective radius filtered to mitigate solar zenith angle bias, the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) cloud-top height-optical depth (CTH-OD) histogram, the liquid water path from the University of Wisconsin dataset, and ice cloud properties from CloudSat. This cloud database is used to compute reflected shortwave radiation as a function of month and location over the ocean from 40 degrees to 60 degrees S, which compares well with observations of reflected shortwave radiation. This calculation is then used to test the sensitivity of the seasonal variation of shortwave reflection to the observed seasonal variation of cloud properties. Effective radius decreases during the summer season, which results in an increase in reflected solar radiation of 4-8 W m(-2) during summer compared to what would be reflected if the effective radius remained constant at its annual-mean value. Summertime increases in low cloud fraction similarly increase the summertime reflection of solar radiation by 9-11 W m(-2). In-cloud liquid water path is less in summertime, causing the reflected solar radiation to be 1-4 W m(-2) less.",

abstract="Climate models produce an increase in cloud optical depth in midlatitudes associated with climate warming, but the magnitude of this increase and its impact on reflected solar radiation vary from model to model. Transition from ice to liquid in midlatitude clouds is thought to be one mechanism for producing increased cloud optical depth. Here observations of cloud properties are used from a suite of remote sensing instruments to estimate the effect of conversion of ice to liquid associated with warming on reflected solar radiation in the latitude band from 40 degrees to 60 degrees S. The calculated increase in upwelling shortwave radiation (SW up arrow) is found to be important and of comparable magnitude to the increase in SW up arrow associated with warming-induced increases of optical depth in climate models. The region where the authors' estimate increases SW up arrow extends farther equatorward than the region where optical depth increases with warming in models. This difference is likely caused by other mechanisms at work in the models but is also sensitive to the amount of ice present in climate models and its susceptibility to warming.",

abstract="Increasing optical depth poleward of 45 degrees is a robust response to warming in global climate models. Much of this cloud optical depth increase has been hypothesized to be due to transitions from ice-dominated to liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud. In this study, the importance of liquid-ice partitioning for the optical depth feedback is quantified for 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. All models show a monotonic partitioning of ice and liquid as a function of temperature, but the temperature at which ice and liquid are equally mixed (the glaciation temperature) varies by as much as 40K across models. Models that have a higher glaciation temperature are found to have a smaller climatological liquid water path (LWP) and condensed water path and experience a larger increase in LWP as the climate warms. The ice-liquid partitioning curve of each model may be used to calculate the response of LWP to warming. It is found that the repartitioning between ice and liquid in a warming climate contributes at least 20\% to 80\% of the increase in LWP as the climate warms, depending on model. Intermodel differences in the climatological partitioning between ice and liquid are estimated to contribute at least 20\% to the intermodel spread in the high-latitude LWP response in the mixed-phase region poleward of 45 degrees S. It is hypothesized that a more thorough evaluation and constraint of global climate model mixed-phase cloud parameterizations and validation of the total condensate and ice-liquid apportionment against observations will yield a substantial reduction in model uncertainty in the high-latitude cloud response to warming.",

abstract="A negative extratropical shortwave cloud feedback driven by changes in cloud optical depth is a feature of global climate models (GCMs). A robust positive trend in observed liquid water path (LWP) over the last two decades across the warming Southern Ocean supports the negative shortwave cloud feedback predicted by GCMs. This feature has been proposed to be due to transitions from ice to liquid with warming. To gain insight into the shortwave cloud feedback we examine extratropical cyclone variability and the response of extratropical cyclones to transient warming in GCM simulations. Multi-Sensor Advanced Climatology Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP) microwave observations of cyclone properties from the period 1992-2015 are contrasted with GCM simulations, with horizontal resolutions ranging from 7 km to hundreds of kilometers. We find that inter-cyclone variability in LWP in both observations and models is strongly driven by the moisture flux along the cyclone's warm conveyor belt (WCB). Stronger WCB moisture flux enhances the LWP within cyclones. This relation-ship is replicated in GCMs, although its strength varies substantially across models. It is found that more than 80\% of the enhancement in Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical cyclone LWP in GCMs in response to a transient 4K warming can be predicted based on the relationship between the WCB moisture flux and cyclone LWP in the historical climate and their change in moisture flux between the historical and warmed climates. Further, it is found that that the robust trend in cyclone LWP over the Southern Ocean in observations and GCMs is consistent with changes in the moisture flux. We propose two cloud feedbacks acting within extratropical cyclones: a negative feedback driven by Clausius-Clapeyron increasing water vapor path (WVP), which enhances the amount of water vapor available to be fluxed into the cyclone, and a feedback moderated by changes in the life cycle and vorticity of cyclones under warming, which changes the rate at which existing moisture is imported into the cyclone. Both terms contribute to increasing LWP within the cyclone. While changes in moisture flux predict cyclone LWP trends in the current climate and the majority of changes in LWP in transient warming simulations, a portion of the LWP increase in response to climate change that is unexplained by increasing moisture fluxes may be due to phase transitions. The variability in LWP within cyclone composites is examined to understand what cyclonic regimes the mixed-phase cloud feedback is relevant to. At a fixed WCB moisture flux cyclone LWP increases with increasing sea surface temperature (SST) in the half of the composite poleward of the low and decreases in the half equatorward of the low in both GCMs and observations. Cloud-top phase partitioning observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) indicates that phase transitions may be driving increases in LWP in the poleward half of cyclones.",

abstract="The change in planetary albedo due to aerosol-cloud interactions during the industrial era is the leading source of uncertainty in inferring Earth's climate sensitivity to increased greenhouse gases from the historical record. The variable that controls aerosol-cloud interactions in warm clouds is droplet number concentration. Global climate models demonstrate that the present-day hemispheric contrast in cloud droplet number concentration between the pristine Southern Hemisphere and the polluted Northern Hemisphere oceans can be used as a proxy for anthropogenically driven change in cloud droplet number concentration. Remotely sensed estimates constrain this change in droplet number concentration to be between 8 cm(-3) and 24 cm(-3). By extension, the radiative forcing since 1850 from aerosol-cloud interactions is constrained to be -1.2 W.m(-2) to -0.6 W.m(-2). The robustness of this constraint depends upon the assumption that pristine Southern Ocean droplet number concentration is a suitable proxy for preindustrial concentrations. Droplet number concentrations calculated from satellite data over the Southern Ocean are high in austral summer. Near Antarctica, they reach values typical of Northern Hemisphere polluted outflows. These concentrations are found to agree with several in situ datasets. In contrast, climate models show systematic underpredictions of cloud droplet number concentration across the Southern Ocean. Near Antarctica, where precipitation sinks of aerosol are small, the underestimation by climate models is particularly large. This motivates the need for detailed process studies of aerosol production and aerosol-cloud interactions in pristine environments. The hemispheric difference in satellite estimated cloud droplet number concentration implies preindustrial aerosol concentrations were higher than estimated by most models.",

Here, we examine the response of extratropical (35°-75°) marine cloud liquid water path (LWP) to a uniform 4 K increase in sea surface temperature (SST) in global climate models (GCMs) from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and variants of the HadGEM3-GC3.1 GCM. Compositing is used to partition data into periods inside and out of cyclones. The response of extratropical LWP to a uniform SST increase and associated atmospheric response varies substantially among GCMs, but the sensitivity of LWP to cloud controlling factors (CCFs) is qualitatively similar. When all other predictors are held constant, increasing moisture flux drives an increase in LWP. Increasing SST, holding all other predictors fixed, leads to a decrease in LWP. The combinations of these changes lead to LWP, and by extension reflected SW, increasing with warming in both hemispheres. Observations predict an increase in reflected SW over oceans of 0.8 Wm-2 to 1.6 Wm-2 per K SST increase (35°N-75°N) and 1.2 Wm-2 to 1.9 Wm-2 per K SST increase (35°S- 75°S). This increase in reflected SW is mainly due to increased moisture convergence into cyclones because of increasing available moisture. The efficiency at which converging moisture is converted into precipitation determines the amount of liquid cloud. Thus, cyclone precipitation processes are critical to constraining extratropical cloud feedbacks.}",

abstract="Atmospheric aerosols, suspended solid and liquid particles, act as nucleation sites for cloud drop formation, affecting clouds and cloud properties-ultimately influencing the cloud dynamics, lifetime, water path, and areal extent that determine the reflectivity (albedo) of clouds. The concentration N-d of droplets in clouds that influences planetary albedo is sensitive to the availability of aerosol particles on which the droplets form. Natural aerosol concentrations affect not only cloud properties themselves but also modulate the sensitivity of clouds to changes in anthropogenic aerosols. It is shown that modeled natural aerosols, principally marine biogenic primary and secondary aerosol sources, explain more than half of the spatiotemporal variability in satellite-observed Nd. Enhanced Nd is spatially correlated with regions of high chlorophyll a, and the spatiotemporal variability in Nd is found to be driven primarily by high concentrations of sulfate aerosol at lower Southern Ocean latitudes (35 degrees to 45 degrees S) and by organic matter in sea spray aerosol at higher latitudes (45 degrees to 55 degrees S). Biogenic sources are estimated to increase the summertime mean reflected solar radiation in excess of 10 W m(-2) over parts of the Southern Ocean, which is comparable to the annual mean increases expected from anthropogenic aerosols over heavily polluted regions of the Northern Hemisphere.",

	Abstract = {We examined the performance of autoconversion (mass transfer from cloud water to rainwater by the coalescence of cloud droplets) schemes in warm rain, which are commonly used in general circulation models. To exclude biases in the different treatment of the aerosol-cloud-precipitation-radiation interaction other than that of the autoconversion process, sensitivity experiments were conducted within a single model framework using an aerosol-climate model, MIROC-SPRINTARS. The liquid water path (LWP) and cloud optical thickness have a particularly high sensitivity to the autoconversion schemes, and their sensitivity is of the same magnitude as model biases. In addition, the ratio of accretion to autoconversion (Acc/Aut ratio), a key parameter in the examination of the balance of microphysical conversion processes, also has a high sensitivity globally depending on the scheme used. Although the Acc/Aut ratio monotonically increases with increasing LWP, significantly lower ratio is observed in Kessler-type schemes. Compared to satellite observations, a poor representation of cloud macrophysical structure and optically thicker low cloud are found in simulations with any autoconversion scheme. As a result of the cloud-radiation interaction, the difference in the global mean net cloud radiative forcing (NetCRF) among the schemes reaches 10 Wm(-2). The discrepancy between the observed and simulated NetCRF is especially large with a high LWP. The potential uncertainty in the parameterization of the autoconversion process is nonnegligible, and no formulation significantly improves the bias in the cloud radiative effect yet. This means that more fundamental errors are still left in other processes of the model.},

	Abstract = {Aerosol-cloud interactions are one of the most uncertain processes in climate models due to their nonlinear complexity. A key complexity arises from the possibility that clouds can respond to perturbed aerosols in two opposite ways, as characterized by the traditional ``cloud lifetime'' hypothesis and more recent ``buffered system'' hypothesis. Their importance in climate simulations remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the response of the liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol perturbations for warm clouds from the perspective of general circulation model (GCM) and A-Train remote sensing, through process-oriented model evaluations. A systematic difference is found in the LWP response between the model results and observations. The model results indicate a near-global uniform increase of LWP with increasing aerosol loading, while the sign of the response of the LWP from the A-Train varies from region to region. The satellite-observed response of the LWP is closely related to meteorological and/or macrophysical factors, in addition to the microphysics. The model does not reproduce this variability of cloud susceptibility (i.e., sensitivity of LWP to perturbed aerosols) because the parameterization of the autoconversion process assumes only suppression of rain formation in response to increased cloud droplet number, and does not consider macrophysical aspects that serve as a mechanism for the negative responses of the LWP via enhancements of evaporation and precipitation. Model biases are also found in the precipitation microphysics, which suggests that the model generates rainwater readily even when little cloud water is present. This essentially causes projections of unrealistically frequent and light rain, with high cloud susceptibilities to aerosol perturbations.},

abstract="A comprehensive two-moment microphysics scheme is incorporated into the MIROC6-SPRINTARS general circulation model (GCM). The new scheme includes prognostic precipitation for both rain and snow and considers their radiative effects. To evaluate the impacts of applying different treatments of precipitation and the associated radiative effect, we perform climate simulations employing both the traditional diagnostic and new prognostic precipitation schemes, the latter also being tested with and without incorporating the radiative effect of snow. The prognostic precipitation, which maintains precipitation in the atmosphere across multiple time steps, models the ratio of accretion to autoconversion as being approximately an order of magnitude higher than that for the diagnostic scheme. Such changes in microphysical process rates tend to reduce the cloud water susceptibility as the autoconversion process is the only pathway through which aerosols can influence rain formation. The resultant anthropogenic aerosol effect is reduced by approximately 21{\%} in the prognostic precipitation scheme. Modifications to the microphysical process rates also change the vertical distribution of hydrometeors in the manner that increases the fractional occurrence of single-layered warm clouds by 38{\%}. The new scheme mitigates the excess of supercooled liquid water produced by the previous scheme and increases the total mass of ice hydrometeors. Both characteristics are consistent with CloudSat/CALIPSO retrievals. The radiative effect of snow is significant at both longwave and shortwave (6.4 and 5.1 W/m(2) in absolute values, respectively) and can alter the precipitation fields via energetic controls on precipitation. These results suggest that the prognostic precipitation scheme, with its radiative effects incorporated, makes an indispensable contribution to improving the reliability of climate modeling.",

abstract="The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observational Simulator Package (COSP) is used to diagnose model performance and physical processes via an apple-to-apple comparison to satellite measurements. Although the COSP provides useful information about clouds and their climatic impact, outputs that have a subcolumn dimension require large amounts of data. This can cause a bottleneck when conducting sets of sensitivity experiments or multiple model intercomparisons. Here, we incorporate two diagnostics for warm rain microphysical processes into the latest version of the simulator (COSP2). The first one is the occurrence frequency of warm rain regimes (i.e., non-precipitating, drizzling, and precipitating) classified according to CloudSat radar reflectivity, putting the warm rain process diagnostics into the context of the geographical distributions of precipitation. The second diagnostic is the probability density function of radar reflectivity profiles normalized by the in-cloud optical depth, the so-called contoured frequency by optical depth diagram (CFODD), which illustrates how the warm rain processes occur in the vertical dimension using statistics constructed from CloudSat and MODIS simulators. The new diagnostics are designed to produce statistics online along with subcolumn information during the COSP execution, eliminating the need to output subcolumn variables. Users can also readily conduct regional analysis tailored to their particular research interest (e.g., land-ocean differences) using an auxiliary post-process package after the COSP calculation. The inline diagnostics are applied to the MIROC6 general circulation model (GCM) to demonstrate how known biases common among multiple GCMs relative to satellite observations are revealed. The inline multi-sensor diagnostics are intended to serve as a tool that facilitates process-oriented model evaluations in a manner that reduces the burden on modelers for their diagnostics effort.",

Attempts to use observations to constrain the parameterizations of cloud processes in GCMs have failed to reduce the disagreement. We propose using observations sensitive to the relevant cloud processes rather than only to the atmospheric state and focusing on process realism in the absence of aerosol perturbations in addition to the process susceptibility to aerosols. We show that process-sensitive observations of precipitation can reduce the uncertainty on GCM estimates of rapid cloud adjustments to aerosols. The feasibility of an observational constraint depends on understanding the precipitation intensity spectrum in both observations and models and also on improving methods to compare the two.",

Active lidar and radar instruments on board CALIPSO and CloudSat allow the vertical distribution of clouds and their optical properties to be studied on a global scale. To evaluate the clouds modeled by ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat, the lidar and radar satellite simulators of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project's Observation Simulator Package are used. Comparison of ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat found large-scale features resolved by the model, such as the Hadley circulation, are captured well. The lidar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the amount of high-level clouds, particularly optically thin clouds. High-altitude clouds in ECHAM5 consistently produced greater lidar scattering ratios compared with CALIPSO. Consequently, the lidar signal in ECHAM5 frequently attenuated high in the atmosphere. The large scattering ratios were due to an underestimation of effective ice crystal radii in ECHAM5. Doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the scattering ratios and frequency of attenuation. Additionally, doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the detection of ECHAM5's highest-level clouds by the radar simulator, in better agreement with CloudSat. ECHAM5 was also shown to significantly underestimate midlevel clouds and (sub)tropical low-level clouds. The low-level clouds produced were consistently perceived by the lidar simulator as too optically thick. The radar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the frequency of precipitation, yet underestimates its intensity compared with CloudSat observations. These findings imply compensating mechanisms in ECHAM5 balance out the radiative imbalance caused by incorrect optical properties of clouds and consistently large hydrometeors in the atmosphere.",

This definition alone is insufficient for the distinction between regimes and limits the comparison of low-level clouds from CloudSat radar observations and the ECHAM5 GCM run with the COSP radar simulator. Comparisons of CloudSat radar cloud altitude-reflectivity histograms for stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes, as defined above, show nearly identical reflectivity profiles, because the distinction between the two regimes is dependent upon atmospheric stability below 700 hPa and observations above 1.5 km. Regional subsets, near California and Hawaii, for example, have large differences in reflectivity profiles than the dynamically defined domain; indicating different reflectivity profiles exist under a given large-scale environment. Regional subsets are better for the evaluation of low-level clouds in CloudSat and ECHAM5 as there is less contamination between 2.5 km and 7.5 km from precipitating hydrometeors which obscured cloud reflectivities.",

abstract="Three different boundary layer cloud models are incorporated into the ECHAM5 general circulation model (GCM) and compared to CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite observations. The first boundary layer model builds upon the standard Tiedtke (1989) parameterization for shallow convection with an adapted convective trigger; the second is a bulk parameterization of the effects of transient shallow cumulus clouds; and lastly the Dual Mass Flux (DMF) scheme adjusted to better represent shallow convection. The three schemes improved (Sub) Tropical oceanic low-level cloud cover, however, the fraction of low-level cloud cover remains underestimated compared to CALIPSO observations. The representation of precipitation was improved by all schemes as they reduced the frequency of light intensity events <0.01 mm d(-1), which were found to dominate the radar reflectivity histograms as well as be the greatest source of differences between ECHAM5 and CloudSat radar reflectivity histograms. For both lidar and radar diagnostics, the differences amongst the schemes are smaller than the differences compared to observations. While the DMF approach remains experimental, as its top-of-atmosphere radiative balance has not been retuned, it shows the most promise in producing nonprecipitating boundary layer clouds. With its internally consistent boundary layer scheme that uses the same bimodal joint distribution with a diffusive and an updraft component for clouds and turbulent transport, the ECHAM5\_DMF produces the most realistic boundary layer depth as indicated by the cloud field. In addition, it reduced the frequency of large-scale precipitation intensities of <0.01 mm d(-1) the greatest.",

This study analyses the value of improved information about a variety of geophysical and economic processes. The value of information is estimated using the ''PRICE model'' which is a probabilistic extension of earlier models of the economics of global warming. The study uses five different approaches to estimating the value of information about all uncertain parameters and about individual parameters. It is estimated that the value of early information is between \$1 and \$2 billion for each year that resolution of uncertainty is moved toward the present. We estimate that the most important uncertain variables are the damages of climate change and the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Resolving the uncertainties about these two parameters would contribute 75 percent of the value of improved knowledge."

abstract="Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) robustly predict that the rate of increase in global-mean precipitation with global-mean surface temperature increase is much less than the rate of increase of water vapor. The goal of this paper is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which precipitation increase is constrained by radiative cooling. Changes in clear-sky atmospheric radiative cooling resulting from changes in temperature and humidity in global warming simulations are in good agreement with the multimodel, global-mean precipitation increase projected by GCMs (similar to 1.1 W m(-2) K-1).In an atmosphere with fixed specific humidity, radiative cooling from the top of the atmosphere (TOA) increases in response to a uniform temperature increase of the surface and atmosphere, while atmospheric cooling by exchange with the surface decreases because the upward emission of longwave radiation from the surface increases more than the downward longwave radiation from the atmosphere. When a fixed relative humidity (RH) assumption is made, however, uniform warming causes a much smaller increase of cooling at the TOA, and the surface contribution reverses to an increase in net cooling rate due to increased downward emission from water vapor. Sensitivity of precipitation changes to lapse rate changes is modest when RH is fixed. Carbon dioxide reduces TOA emission with only weak effects on surface fluxes, and thus suppresses precipitation. The net atmospheric cooling response and thereby the precipitation response to CO2-induced warming at fixed RH are mostly contributed by changes in surface fluxes. The role of clouds is discussed.Intermodel spread in the rate of precipitation increase across the CMIP5 simulations is attributed to differences in the atmospheric cooling.",

	Abstract = {Satellite-based estimates of the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) are
   consistently smaller than the estimates from global aerosol models, and,
   partly as a result of these differences, the assessment of this climate
   forcing includes large uncertainties. Satellite estimates typically use
   the present-day (PD) relationship between observed cloud drop number
   concentrations (N(c)) and aerosol optical depths (AODs) to determine the
   preindustrial (PI) values of N(c). These values are then used to
   determine the PD and PI cloud albedos and, thus, the effect of
   anthropogenic aerosols on top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes. Here,
   we use a model with realistic aerosol and cloud processes to show that
   empirical relationships for In (N(c)) versus In (AOD) derived from PD
   results do not represent the atmospheric perturbation caused by the
   addition of anthropogenic aerosols to the preindustrial atmosphere. As a
   result, the model estimates based on satellite methods of the AIE are
   between a factor of 3 to more than a factor of 6 smaller than model
   estimates based on actual PD and PI values for N(c). Using In(N(c))
   versus In(AI) (Aerosol Index, or the optical depth times angstrom
   exponent) to estimate preindustrial values for N(c) provides estimates
   for N(c) and forcing that are closer to the values predicted by the
   model. Nevertheless, the AIE using In(N(c)) versus In(AI) may be
   substantially incorrect on a regional basis and may underestimate or
   overestimate the global average forcing by 25 to 35\%.},

abstract="Tropospheric aerosols are thought to have three important effects on the Earth's radiation budget: the direct radiative effect(1) (perturbation of clear-sky reflectivity), the indirect radiative effect(2) (modification of cloud albedo) and the effect on the hydrological cycle(3) (modification of the vertical thickness and horizontal extent of clouds). The first two effects have been understood in principle for nearly 20 years, and quantitative estimates of their magnitudes have been provided by models and observations(4). The third phenomenon, and its relation to the other two, has received far less attention. Previous work(3) has shown, however, that increases in aerosol concentration may act to increase cloud albedo by increasing horizontal cloud fraction as well as cloud reflectivity. Here we use a simple model of the marine cloud-topped boundary layer to investigate the changes in cloud thickness and albedo that result from changes in precipitation as particle concentrations vary. We find that the sensitivity of layer cloud albedo to droplet number concentration (the albedo susceptibility) is increased by 50-200\% when the dependence of cloud thickness on particle number is included. The results suggest that the response of cloud thickness to changes in aerosol particle concentration must be taken into account for accurate prediction of global albedo by climate models.",

	Abstract = {This study investigates the sensitivity of the total anthropogenic aerosol effect to the treatment of rain within the global climate model (GCM) ECHAM5. A comparison between a prognostic (rain is stored within the atmosphere) and a diagnostic rain scheme (rain is precipitated out within one model time step) is conducted. Furthermore, the shape of the rain drop distribution within the prognostic rain scheme is varied. The prognostic rain scheme shifts the emphasis of the rain production process from autoconversion to accretion in better agreement with observations. Since the parameterization of the accretion process is independent of the cloud droplet number concentration, the total anthropogenic aerosol effect decreased by 0.5 to 0.9 Wm(-2). Varying the rain drop distribution has a smaller influence on the total anthropogenic aerosol effect, changing it by 0.2 to 0.3 Wm(-2). Citation: Posselt, R., and U.

@article{Quaas2009,
	Abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects continue to constitute one of the most
   important uncertainties for anthropogenic climate perturbations. Within
   the international AEROCOM initiative, the representation of
   aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general
   circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets.
   The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not
   include ice nucleation effects, and none of the model explicitly
   parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute
   statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) and
   various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent
   between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the
   model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number
   concentration (N-d) compares relatively well to the satellite data at
   least over the ocean. The relationship between tau(a) and liquid water
   path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that
   the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms
   of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A
   positive relationship between total cloud fraction (f(cld)) and tau(a)
   as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the
   models, albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of
   them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to
   explain the satellite-derived strong f(cld)-tau(a) relationship, our
   results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation.
   Relationships similar to the ones found in satellite data between tau(a)
   and cloud top temperature or outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) are
   simulated by only a few GCMs. The GCMs that simulate a negative
   OLR-tau(a) relationship show a strong positive correlation between
   tau(a) and f(cld). The short-wave total aerosol radiative forcing as
   simulated by the GCMs is strongly influenced by the simulated
   anthropogenic fraction of tau(a), and parameterisation assumptions such
   as a lower bound on N-d. Nevertheless, the strengths of the statistical
   relationships are good predictors for the aerosol forcings in the
   models. An estimate of the total short-wave aerosol forcing inferred
   from the combination of these predictors for the modelled forcings with
   the satellite-derived statistical relationships yields a global annual
   mean value of -1.5 +/- 0.5 Wm(-2). In an alternative approach, the
   radiative flux perturbation due to anthropogenic aerosols can be broken
   down into a component over the cloud-free portion of the globe
   (approximately the aerosol direct effect) and a component over the
   cloudy portion of the globe (approximately the aerosol indirect effect).
   An estimate obtained by scaling these simulated clear- and cloudy-sky
   forcings with estimates of anthropogenic tau(a) and satellite-retrieved
   N-d-tau(a) regression slopes, respectively, yields a global, annual-mean
   aerosol direct effect estimate of -0.4 +/- 0.2 Wm(-2) and a cloudy-sky
   (aerosol indirect effect) estimate of -0.7 +/- 0.5 Wm(-2), with a total
   estimate of -1.2 +/- 0.4 Wm(-2).},

Therefore we discuss, in how far a particular process or component of the carbon cycle can be identified, that potentially contributes most to the positive feedback. The discussion is based on simulations with a carbon cycle model, which is embedded in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. Two simulations covering the period 1860-2100 are conducted to determine the impact of global warming on the carbon cycle. Forced by historical and future carbon dioxide emissions (following the scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), they reveal a noticeable positive climate-carbon cycle feedback, which is mainly driven by the tropical land biosphere. The oceans contribute much less to the positive feedback and the temperate/boreal terrestrial biosphere induces a minor negative feedback. The contrasting behavior of the tropical and temperate/boreal land biosphere is mostly attributed to opposite trends in their net primary productivity (NPP) under global warming conditions. As these findings depend on the model employed they are compared with results derived from other climate-carbon cycle models, which participated in the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).",

abstract="Changes in aerosols cause a change in net top-of-the-atmosphere (ToA) short-wave and long-wave radiative fluxes; rapid adjustments in clouds, water vapour and temperature; and an effective radiative forcing (ERF) of the planetary energy budget. The diverse sources of model uncertainty and the computational cost of running climate models make it difficult to isolate the main causes of aerosol ERF uncertainty and to understand how observations can be used to constrain it. We explore the aerosol ERF uncertainty by using fast model emulators to generate a very large set of aerosol-climate model variants that span the model uncertainty due to 27 parameters related to atmospheric and aerosol processes. Sensitivity analyses shows that the uncertainty in the ToA flux is dominated (around 80 \%) by uncertainties in the physical atmosphere model, particularly parameters that affect cloud reflectivity. However, uncertainty in the change in ToA flux caused by aerosol emissions over the industrial period (the aerosol ERF) is controlled by a combination of uncertainties in aerosol (around 60 \%) and physical atmosphere (around 40 \%) parameters. Four atmospheric and aerosol parameters account for around 80\% of the uncertainty in short-wave ToA flux (mostly parameters that directly scale cloud reflectivity, cloud water content or cloud droplet concentrations), and these parameters also account for around 60\% of the aerosol ERF uncertainty. The common causes of uncertainty mean that constraining the modelled planetary brightness to tightly match satellite observations changes the lower 95\% credible aerosol ERF value from -2.65 to -2.37 W m(-2). This suggests the strongest forcings (below around -2.4 W m(-2)) are inconsistent with observations. These results show that, regardless of the fact that the ToA flux is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the aerosol ERF, the observed flux can constrain the uncertainty in ERF because their values are connected by constrainable process parameters. The key to reducing the aerosol ERF uncertainty further will be to identify observations that can additionally constrain individual parameter ranges and/or combined parameter effects, which can be achieved through sensitivity analysis of perturbed parameter ensembles.",

abstract="Autoconversion is a highly nonlinear process, which is usually evaluated in global climate models (GCMs) from the mean in-cloud value of the liquid-water mixing ratio q(l)'. This biases the calculated autoconversion rate, and may explain why it usually seems to be necessary to reduce the autoconversion threshold to an unrealistically low value to obtain a realistic simulation in a GCM. Two versions of a threshold-dependent autoconversion parameterization are compared in the CSIRO GCM. In the standard (``OLD'') treatment, autoconversion occurs in a grid box whenever the mean in-cloud q(l)' exceeds the threshold q(crit), which is derived from a prescribed threshold cloud-droplet radius r(crit). In the modified (``NEW'') version, the assumed subgrid moisture distribution from the model's condensation scheme is applied in each grid box to determine the fraction of the cloudy area in which q(l)' > q(crit), and autoconversion occurs in this fraction only. Simulations are performed using both treatments, for present-day and preindustrial distributions of cloud-droplet concentration, and using different values for r(crit). Changing from the OLD to the NEW treatment means that r(crit) can be increased from 7.5 mu m to a more realistic 9.3 mu m, while maintaining the global-mean liquid-water path at about the same value. Simulations for preindustrial and present-day conditions are compared, to see whether the change of scheme alters the modeled cloud-lifetime effect. It is found that the NEW scheme with r(crit) = 9.3 mu m gives a 0.5 W m(-2) (62\%) stronger cloud-lifetime effect than the OLD scheme with r(crit) = 7.5 mu m.",

	Abstract = {A new stratiform cloud scheme including a two-moment bulk microphysics module, a cloud cover parameterization allowing ice supersaturation, and an ice nucleation parameterization has been implemented into the recently developed GFDL AM3 general circulation model (GCM) as part of an effort to treat aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions more realistically. Unlike the original scheme, the new scheme facilitates the study of cloud-ice-aerosol interactions via influences of dust and sulfate on ice nucleation. While liquid and cloud ice water path associated with stratiform clouds are similar for the new and the original scheme, column integrated droplet numbers and global frequency distributions (PDFs) of droplet effective radii differ significantly. This difference is in part due to a difference in the implementation of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) mechanism, which leads to a larger contribution from super-cooled droplets in the original scheme. Clouds are more likely to be either completely glaciated or liquid due to the WBF mechanism in the new scheme. Super-saturations over ice simulated with the new scheme are in qualitative agreement with observations, and PDFs of ice numbers and effective radii appear reasonable in the light of observations. Especially, the temperature dependence of ice numbers qualitatively agrees with in-situ observations. The global average long-wave cloud forcing decreases in comparison to the original scheme as expected when super-saturation over ice is allowed. Anthropogenic aerosols lead to a larger decrease in short-wave absorption (SWABS) in the new model setup, but outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) decreases as well, so that the net effect of including anthropogenic aerosols on the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere (netradTOA = SWABS-OLR) is of similar magnitude for the new and the original scheme.},

abstract="Global climate models simulate a robust increase of global mean precipitation of about 1.5 to 2\% per Kelvin surface warming in response to greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Here, it is shown that the sensitivity to aerosol cooling is robust as well, albeit roughly twice as large. This larger sensitivity is consistent with energy budget arguments. At the same time, it is still considerably lower than the 6.5 to 7\% K-1 decrease of the water vapor concentration with cooling from anthropogenic aerosol because the water vapor radiative feedback lowers the hydrological sensitivity to anthropogenic forcings. When GHG and aerosol forcings are combined, the climate models with a realistic 20th century warming indicate that the global mean precipitation increase due to GHG warming has, until recently, been completely masked by aerosol drying. This explains the apparent lack of sensitivity of the global mean precipitation to the net global warming recently found in observations. As the importance of GHG warming increases in the future, a clear signal will emerge.",

In this study, the aerosol impacts on cloud microphysics are examined in the context of the boundary-layer diurnal cycle using 36-h LES simulations of pristine and polluted clouds. These simulations corroborate previous findings that during nighttime aerosol-induced liquid water path changes are sensitive to the large-scale forcings via enhancement of cloud-top entrainment such that, ultimately, the liquid water path may be reduced when the free-tropospheric-entrained air is drier. During the day, however, enhanced entrainment, inhibition of drizzle evaporation below cloud base, and reduced sensible heat flux from the surface lead to a more pronounced decoupling of the boundary layer, which significantly amplifies the liquid water path reduction of the polluted clouds. At night the sign of the liquid water path difference between pristine and polluted clouds depends upon large-scale forcings, while during the day the liquid water path of polluted clouds is always smaller than the one of the pristine clouds. Suggestions are made on how observational studies could be designed for validation of these simulations.",

	Abstract = {A new parameterization with three prognostic liquid water classes was implemented into the general circulation model (GCM) ECHAM5 with the aerosol module HAM in order to improve the global representation of rain formation in marine stratiform clouds. The additionally introduced drizzle class improves the physical representation of the droplet spectrum and, more importantly, improves the microphysical processes relevant for precipitation formation compared to the standard parameterization. In order to avoid a mismatch of the liquid and ice phase, a prognostic treatment of snow has been introduced too. This has a significant effect on the amount and altitude of ice clouds, which in turn affects not only the in-and outgoing radiation but also the parameterized collection rates. With the introduction of a prognostic precipitation scheme, a more realistic representation of both liquid and ice phase large-scale precipitation is achieved compared to a diagnostic treatment. An encouraging finding is that with the prognostic treatment the increase of the liquid water path in response to anthropogenic aerosols is reduced by about 25 \%. Although the total net radiative forcing is decreased from -1.3 +/- 0.3 to -1.6 +/- 0.3W m(-2) from the control to the prognostic model version, the difference is within the interannual variability. Altogether the results suggest that the treatment of precipitation in global circulation models has not only a significant influence on the phase of clouds and their conversion rates, but also hints towards uncertainties related to a prognostic precipitation scheme.},

Knowing how and why climate models are tuned and which targets are used is essential to avoiding possible misattributions of skillful predictions to data accommodation and vice versa. This paper describes the approach and practice of model tuning for the six major US climate modeling centers. While details differ among groups in terms of scientific missions, tuning targets, and tunable parameters, there is a core commonality of approaches. However, practices differ significantly on some key aspects, in particular, in the use of initialized forecast analyses as a tool, the explicit use of the historical transient record, and the use of the present-day radiative imbalance vs. the implied balance in the preindustrial era as a target.},

For echoes above this intensity threshold, the products derived from reflectivity, particularly maps of rainfall rate and convective/stratiform classification, compare well, even though slightly different convective-stratiform separation techniques and different reflectivity-rainfall rate (Z-R) relations are used for the PR and KR. The KR observations indicate the PR misses only 2.3\% of near-surface rainfall but 46\% of near-surface rain area (greater than or equal to0 dBZ) because of its 17-dBZ threshold. The PR senses less than 15\% of the echo area observed by the KR above 5-km altitude (i.e., above the 0 degreesC level). Thus, the PR highly undersamples weaker echoes associated with stratiform rain near the surface and ice particles aloft but still manages to capture most of the near-surface precipitation accumulation. The temporal sampling of the TRMM PR accurately captures the KR's overall frequency distribution of reflectivity and its subdivision into convective and stratiform components. However, diurnal and latitudinal variations of precipitation in the vicinity of Kwajalein are not well sampled.",

abstract="Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends realistically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number density, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in relative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized precipitating cumulus cloud field is small.",

abstract="Cloud responses to changes in aerosol remain a dominant uncertainty in the radiative forcing of climate. Two main constructs related to aerosol effects on clouds have been postulated: (i) the ``albedo effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol results in increased droplet concentrations that generate increases in cloud albedo, all else (particularly cloud water) being equal; (ii) the ''lifetime effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol suppresses precipitation and results in clouds with more liquid water, higher fractional cloudiness, and longer lifetimes. Based on new observations presented here, and supported by previous fine-scale modeling studies, we suggest that the balance of evidence shows that non-precipitating cumulus clouds can experience an evaporation-entrainment feedback, and respond to aerosol perturbations in a manner inconsistent with the traditional ``lifetime effect.'' Because most cumulus clouds evaporate without producing significant precipitation, this is particularly relevant to estimates of aerosol indirect effects on climate. Citation: Small, J. D., P. Y.

Stage IV accumulations are employed in a variety of applications, and while the WSR-88D systems are well suited for observing heavy rain events that are likely to affect flooding, limitations in surface radar and gauge measurements can result in missed precipitation, especially near topography and in the western United States. This paper compares hourly Stage IV observations of precipitation occurrence to collocated observations from the 94-GHz CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar, which provides excellent sensitivity to light and frozen precipitation. Statistics from 4 yr of comparisons show that the CloudSat observes precipitation considerably more frequently than the Stage IV dataset, especially in northern states where frozen precipitation is prevalent in the cold season. The skill of Stage IV for precipitation detection is found to decline rapidly when the near-surface air temperature falls below 0 degrees C. As a result, agreement between Stage IV and CloudSat tends to be best in the southeast, where radar coverage is good and moderate-to-heavy liquid precipitation dominates. Stage IV and CloudSat precipitation detection characteristics are documented for each of the individual river forecast centers that contribute to the Stage IV dataset to provide guidance regarding potential sampling biases that may impact hydrologic applications.",

To facilitate the satellite and GCM comparisons, the CFMIP (Cloud Feedback Model Inter-comparison Project) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been developed and is now increasingly used in GCM evaluations. Real-world clouds and precipitation can have significant sub-grid variations, which, however, are often ignored or oversimplified in the COSP simulation. In this study, we use COSP cloud simulations from the Super-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM5) and satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and CloudSat to demonstrate the importance of considering the sub-grid variability of cloud and precipitation when using the COSP to evaluate GCM simulations. We carry out two sensitivity tests: SPCAM5 COSP and SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP. In the SPCAM5 COSP run, the sub-grid cloud and precipitation properties from the embedded cloud-resolving model (CRM) of SPCAM5 are used to drive the COSP simulation, while in the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run only grid-mean cloud and precipitation properties (i.e., no sub-grid variations) are given to the COSP. We find that the warm rain signatures in the SPCAM5 COSP run agree with the MODIS and CloudSat observations quite well. In contrast, the SPCAM5-Homogeneous COSP run which ignores the sub-grid cloud variations substantially overestimates the radar reflectivity and probability of precipitation compared to the satellite observations, as well as the results from the SPCAM5 COSP run. The significant differences between the two COSP runs demonstrate that it is important to take into account the sub-grid variations of cloud and precipitation when using COSP to evaluate the GCM to avoid confusing and misleading results.",

Models of varying complexity and satellite observations from NASA's A-Train constellation of satellites are used to determine what controls the precipitation susceptibility of warm clouds to aerosol perturbations. Three susceptibility regimes are identified: (i) clouds with low liquid water path (LWP) generate very little rain and are least susceptible to aerosol; (ii) clouds with intermediate LWP where aerosol most effectively suppress precipitation; and (iii) clouds with high LWP, where the susceptibility begins to decrease because the precipitation process is efficient owing to abundant liquid water.

The Cloudsat cloud profiling radar (CPR) has been operating since 2 June 2006 and has proven to be remarkably stable since turn-on. A number of products have been developed using these space-borne radar data as principal inputs. Combined with other A-Train sensor data, these new observations offer unique, global views of the vertical structure of clouds and precipitation jointly. Approximately 11\% of clouds detected over the global oceans produce precipitation that, in all likelihood, reaches the surface. Warm precipitating clouds are both wetter and composed of larger particles than nonprecipitating clouds. The frequency of precipitation increases significantly with increasing cloud depth, and the increased depth and water path of precipitating clouds leads to increased optical depths and substantially more sunlight reflected from precipitating clouds compared to than nonprecipitating warm clouds. The CloudSat observations also provide an authoritative estimate of global ice water paths. The observed ice water paths are larger than those predicted from most climate models. CloudSat observations also indicate that clouds radiatively heat the global mean atmospheric column (relative to clear skies) by about 10 Wm(-2). Although this heating appears to be contributed almost equally by solar and infrared absorption, the latter contribution is shown to vary significantly with latitude being influenced by the predominant cloud structures of the different region in questions.",

Methodologies developed to analyze CloudSat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations are employed to investigate the cloud-to-precipitation process of warm clouds and are applied to the model results to examine how the models represent the process for warm stratiform clouds. Despite a limitation of the present study that compares the statistics for stratiform clouds in climate models with those from satellite observations, including both stratiform and (shallow) convective clouds, the statistics constructed with the methodologies are compared between the models and satellite observations to expose their similarities and differences. A problem common to some models is that they tend to produce rain at a faster rate than is observed. These model characteristics are further examined in the context of cloud microphysics parameterizations using a simplified one-dimensional model of warm rain formation that isolates key microphysical processes from full interactions with other processes in global climate models. The one-dimensional model equivalent statistics reproduce key characteristics of the global model statistics when corresponding autoconversion schemes are assumed in the one-dimensional model. The global model characteristics depicted by the statistics are then interpreted as reflecting behaviors of the autoconversion parameterizations adopted in the models. Comparisons of the one-dimensional model with satellite observations hint at improvements to the formulation of the parameterization scheme, thus offering a novel way of constraining key parameters in autoconversion schemes of global models.",

abstract="A common problem in climate models is that they are likely to produce rain at a faster rate than is observed and therefore produce too much light rain (e.g., drizzle). Interestingly, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) multiscale modeling framework (MMF), whose warm-rain formation process is more realistic than other global models, has the opposite problem: the rain formation process in PNNL-MMF is less efficient than the real world. To better understand the microphysical processes in warm cloud, this study documents the model biases in PNNL-MMF and evaluates warm cloud properties, subgrid variability, and microphysics, using A-Train satellite observations to identify sources of model biases in PNNL-MMF. Like other models PNNL-MMF underpredicts the warm cloud fraction with compensating large optical depths. Associated with these compensating errors in cloudiness are compensating errors in the precipitation process. For a given liquid water path, clouds in the PNNL-MMF are less likely to produce rain than are real-world clouds. However, when the model does produce rain it is able to produce stronger precipitation than reality. As a result PNNL-MMF produces about the correct mean rain rate with an incorrect distribution of rates. The subgrid variability in PNNL-MMF is also tested, and results are fairly consistent with observations, suggesting that the possible sources of model biases are likely to be due to errors in its microphysics or dynamics rather than errors in the subgrid-scale variability produced by the embedded cloud resolving model.",

abstract="The increase in cloud optical depth with warming at middle and high latitudes is a robust cloud feedback response found across all climate models. This study builds on results that suggest the optical depth response to temperature is timescale invariant for low-level clouds. The timescale invariance allows one to use satellite observations to constrain the models' optical depth feedbacks. Three passive-sensor satellite retrievals are compared against simulations from eight models from the Atmosphere Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) of the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This study confirms that the low-cloud optical depth response is timescale invariant in the AMIP simulations, generally at latitudes higher than 40 degrees. Compared to satellite estimates, most models overestimate the increase in optical depth with warming at the monthly and interannual timescales. Many models also do not capture the increase in optical depth with estimated inversion strength that is found in all three satellite observations and in previous studies. The discrepancy between models and satellites exists in both hemispheres and in most months of the year. A simple replacement of the models' optical depth sensitivities with the satellites' sensitivities reduces the negative shortwave cloud feedback by at least 50\% in the 40 degrees-70 degrees S latitude band and by at least 65\% in the 40 degrees-70 degrees N latitude band. Based on this analysis of satellite observations, we conclude that the low-cloud optical depth feedback at middle and high latitudes is likely too negative in climate models.",

abstract="Ground-based observations from three middle- and high-latitude sites managed by the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program are used to determine the sensitivity of the low-cloud optical depth to temperature and to test whether observations support mechanisms previously proposed to affect the optical depth feedback. Analysis of cloud optical depth retrievals support previous satellite findings that the optical depth decreases or stays constant with increases in temperature when the cloud is warm but increases when the cloud is cold. The cloud liquid water path sensitivity to warming largely explains the optical depth sensitivity at all sites. Mechanisms examined in this study involve the temperature dependence of (a) the moist-adiabatic lapse rate, (b) cloud phase partitioning, (c) drying efficiency of cloud top mixing, (d) cloud top inversion strength, and (e) boundary layer decoupling. Mechanism (a) is present across all clouds and explains 30{\%} to 50{\%} of the increase in liquid water path with warming at temperatures below 0 degrees C. However, the cloud's adiabaticity, the ratio between the liquid water path and its theoretical maximum, is at least as important and determines how the liquid water path sensitivity to temperature varies with temperature. At temperatures below 0 degrees C, the adiabaticity increases with warming, and the data support mechanism (b). At warmer temperatures, the adiabaticity decreases with warming, overwhelming mechanism (a) and resulting in the liquid water path decreasing with warming. This adiabaticity decrease arises primarily because of mechanism (d), and to a lesser degree because of mechanism (e). No evidence is found supporting mechanism (c).",

abstract="Most global climate models parameterize separate cloud types using separate parameterizations. This approach has several disadvantages, including obscure interactions between parameterizations and inaccurate triggering of cumulus parameterizations. Alternatively, a unified cloud parameterization uses one equation set to represent all cloud types. Such cloud types include stratiform liquid and ice cloud, shallow convective cloud, and deep convective cloud. Vital to the success of a unified parameterization is a general interface between clouds and microphysics. One such interface involves drawing Monte Carlo samples of subgrid variability of temperature, water vapor, cloud liquid, and cloud ice, and feeding the sample points into a microphysics scheme. This study evaluates a unified cloud parameterization and a Monte Carlo microphysics interface that has been implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5.3. Model computational expense is estimated, and sensitivity to the number of subcolumns is investigated. Results describing the mean climate and tropical variability from global simulations are presented.

    abstract = { Abstract Observational studies indicate that a mass flux approach may provide a realistic framework for cumulus parameterization in large-scale models, but this approach, through the introduction of a spectral cloud ensemble, leads normally to rather complex schemes. In this paper the question is addressed whether much simpler schemes can already provide realistic values of the thermal forcing by convection under various synoptic conditions. This is done through verifying such a scheme first on data from field experiments for periods of tropical penetrative convection (GATE, Marshall Islands), tradewind cumuli (ATEX, BOMEX) and extratropical organized convection (SESAME-79) and then in a NWP model. The scheme considers a population of clouds where the cloud ensemble is described by a one-dimensional bulk model as earlier applied by Yanai et al. in a diagnostic study of tropical convection. Cumulus scale downdrafts are included. Various types of convection are represented, i.e., penetrative convection in connection with large-scale convergent flow, shallow convection in suppressed conditions like tradewind cumuli and midlevel convection like extratropical organized convection associated with potentially unstable air above the boundary layer and large-scale ascent. The closure assumptions for determining the bulk cloud mass flux are: penetrative convection and midlevel convection are maintained by large-scale moisture convergence and shallow convection by supply of moisture due to surface evaporation. The parameterization produces realistic fields of convective heating and appears to be in fair balance with real data for NWP as it does not initiate strong adjustment processes (spinup) in global form. }

pages="12492--12500",
abstract="Aerosol-cloud interaction is the most uncertain mechanism of anthropogenic radiative forcing of Earth's climate, and aerosol-induced cloud water changes are particularly poorly constrained in climate models. By combining satellite retrievals of volcano and ship tracks in stratocumulus clouds, we compile a unique observational data set and confirm that liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosols are bidirectional, and on average the increases in LWP are closely compensated by the decreases. Moreover, the meteorological parameters controlling the LWP responses are strikingly similar between the volcano and ship tracks. In stark contrast to observations, there are substantial unidirectional increases in LWP in the Hadley Centre climate model, because the model accounts only for the decreased precipitation efficiency and not for the enhanced entrainment drying. If the LWP increases in the model were compensated by the decreases as the observations suggest, its indirect aerosol radiative forcing in stratocumulus regions would decrease by 45\%. Plain Language Summary It remains unclear how much of the global warming induced by greenhouse gases is offset by aerosols because the effect of aerosol particles on clouds is the most uncertain mechanism of forcing of Earth's climate by human activities. Cloud water responses to aerosols are especially uncertain. Here we compare the properties of low marine clouds impacted by volcanic and ship emissions with the properties of the nearby unpolluted clouds in order to increase the understanding of aerosol impacts on clouds. Clouds impacted by emissions from volcanoes and ships lose or gain water depending on meteorological conditions, but on average the amount of water does not change much in the polluted clouds. These observations disagree with the systematic increases in cloud water in response to aerosols simulated by the Hadley Centre climate model. This model, like other contemporary climate models, only accounts for cloud water increases that result from decreased precipitation efficiency and does not account for the enhanced drying in polluted clouds. Our results suggest that the ability of aerosols to offset global warming might be overestimated. The observational constraints derived here on aerosol-induced cloud water changes would ultimately translate into reduced uncertainties in projections of the future climate.",

abstract="The cooling of the Earth's climate through the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds offsets an unknown fraction of greenhouse gas warming. An increase in the amount of water inside liquid-phase clouds induced by aerosols, through the suppression of rain formation, has been postulated to lead to substantial cooling, which would imply that the Earth's surface temperature is highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Here we provide direct observational evidence that, instead of a strong increase, aerosols cause a relatively weak average decrease in the amount of water in liquid-phase clouds compared with unpolluted clouds. Measurements of polluted clouds downwind of various anthropogenic sources-such as oil refineries, smelters, coal-fired power plants, cities, wildfires and ships-reveal that aerosol-induced cloud-water increases, caused by suppressed rain formation, and decreases, caused by enhanced evaporation of cloud water, partially cancel each other out. We estimate that the observed decrease in cloud water offsets 23\% of the global climate-cooling effect caused by aerosol-induced increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. These findings invalidate the hypothesis that increases in cloud water cause a substantial climate cooling effect and translate into reduced uncertainty in projections of future climate.",

abstract="The international Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) dataset is used to correlate variations of cloud optical thickness and cloud temperature in today's atmosphere. The analysis focuses on low clouds in order to limit the importance of changes in cloud vertical extent, particle size, and water phase. Coherent patterns of change are observed on several time and space scales. On the planetary scale, clouds in colder, higher latitudes are found to be optically thicker than clouds in warmer, lower latitudes. On the seasonal scale, winter clouds are, for the most part, optically thicker than summer clouds. The logarithmic derivative of cloud optical thickness with temperature is used to describe the sign and magnitude of the optical thickness-temperature correlation. The seasonal, latitudinal, and day-to-day variations of this relation are examined for Northern Hemisphere clouds in 1984. The analysis is done separately for clouds over land and ocean. In cold continental clouds, optical thickness increases with temperature, consistent with the temperature variation of the adiabatic cloud water content. In warm continental and in almost all maritime clouds, however, optical thickness decreases with temperature. The behavior of the optical thickness-temperature relation is usually, though not always, the same whether the temperature variations are driven by seasonal, latitudinal, or day-to-day changes. Important exceptions are noted. Some explanations for the observed behavior are proposed.",

abstract="We have conducted a multi-model intercomparison of cloud-water in five state-of-the-art AGCMs run for control and doubled carbon dioxide climates. The most notable feature of the differences between the control and doubled carbon dioxide climates is in the distribution of cloud-water in the mixed-phase temperature band. The difference is greatest at mid and high latitudes. We found that the amount of cloud lee in the mixed phase layer in the control climate largely determines how much the cloud-water distribution changes for the doubled carbon dioxide climate. Therefore evaluation of the cloud ice distribution by comparison with data is important for future climate sensitivity studies. Cloud ice and cloud liquid both decrease in the layer below the melting layer, but only cloud liquid increases in the mixed-phase layer. Although the decrease in cloud-water below the melting layer occurs at all latitudes, the increase in cloud liquid in the mixed-phase layer is restricted to those latitudes where there is a large amount of cloud ice in the mixed-phase layer. If the cloud ice in the mixed-phase layer is concentrated at high latitudes, doubling of carbon dioxide might shift the center of cloud water distribution poleward which could decrease solar reflection because solar insolation is less at higher latitude. The magnitude of this poleward shift of cloud water appears to be larger for the higher climate sensitivity models, and it is consistent with the associated changes in cloud albedo forcing. For the control climate there is a clear relationship between the differences in cloud-water and relative humidity between the different models, for both magnitude and distribution. On the other hand the ratio of cloud ice to cloud-water follows the threshold temperature which is determined in each model. Improved measurements of relative humidity could be used to constrain the modeled representation of cloud water. At the same time, comparative analysis in global cloud resolving model simulations is necessary for further understanding of the relationships suggested in this paper.",

abstract="Large biases in climate model simulations of cloud radiative properties over the Southern Ocean cause large errors in modeled sea surface temperatures, atmospheric circulation, and climate sensitivity. Here, we combine cloud-resolving model simulations with estimates of the concentration of ice-nucleating particles in this region to show that our simulated Southern Ocean clouds reflect far more radiation than predicted by global models, in agreement with satellite observations. Specifically, we show that the clouds that are most sensitive to the concentration of ice-nucleating particles are low-level mixed-phase clouds in the cold sectors of extra-tropical cyclones, which have previously been identified as a main contributor to the Southern Ocean radiation bias. The very low ice-nucleating particle concentrations that prevail over the Southern Ocean strongly suppress cloud droplet freezing, reduce precipitation, and enhance cloud reflectivity. The results help explain why a strong radiation bias occurs mainly in this remote region away from major sources of ice-nucleating particles. The results present a substantial challenge to climate models to be able to simulate realistic ice-nucleating particle concentrations and their effects under specific meteorological conditions.",

abstract="This study diagnoses the climate sensitivity, radiative forcing and climate feedback estimates from eleven general circulation models participating in the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and analyzes inter-model differences. This is done by taking into account the fact that the climate response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) is not necessarily only mediated by surface temperature changes, but can also result from fast land warming and tropospheric adjustments to the CO2 radiative forcing. By considering tropospheric adjustments to CO2 as part of the forcing rather than as feedbacks, and by using the radiative kernels approach, we decompose climate sensitivity estimates in terms of feedbacks and adjustments associated with water vapor, temperature lapse rate, surface albedo and clouds. Cloud adjustment to CO2 is, with one exception, generally positive, and is associated with a reduced strength of the cloud feedback; the multi-model mean cloud feedback is about 33 \% weaker. Non-cloud adjustments associated with temperature, water vapor and albedo seem, however, to be better understood as responses to land surface warming. Separating out the tropospheric adjustments does not significantly affect the spread in climate sensitivity estimates, which primarily results from differing climate feedbacks. About 70 \% of the spread stems from the cloud feedback, which remains the major source of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, with a large contribution from the tropics. Differences in tropical cloud feedbacks between low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity models occur over a large range of dynamical regimes, but primarily arise from the regimes associated with a predominance of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds. The combined water vapor plus lapse rate feedback also contributes to the spread of climate sensitivity estimates, with inter-model differences arising primarily from the relative humidity responses throughout the troposphere. Finally, this study points to a substantial role of nonlinearities in the calculation of adjustments and feedbacks for the interpretation of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity estimates. We show that in climate model simulations with large forcing (e.g., 4 x CO2), nonlinearities cannot be assumed minor nor neglected. Having said that, most results presented here are consistent with a number of previous feedback studies, despite the very different nature of the methodologies and all the uncertainties associated with them.",

pages="262--278",
abstract="Condensation and turbulent liquid water transport in stratocumulus clouds involve complicated interactions between turbulence dynamics and cloud microphysical processes, and play essential roles in defining the cloud structure. This work aims at understanding this dynamical-microphysical interaction and providing information necessary for parameterizations of the ensemble mean condensation rate and turbulent fluxes of liquid water variables in a coupled turbulence-microphysics model. The approach is to simulate nonprecipitating stratocumulus clouds with a coupled large eddy simulation and an explicit bin-microphysical model, and then perform a budget analysis for four liquid water variables: mean liquid water content, turbulent liquid water flux, mean cloud droplet number concentration, and the number density flux. The results show that the turbulence contribution to the mean condensation rate comes from covariance of the integral cloud droplet radius and supersaturation, which enhances condensation in turbulent updrafts and reduces evaporation in the downdrafts. Turbulent liquid water flux results from a close balance between turbulence dynamics and microphysical processes. Consequently, the flux can be parameterized in terms of the common diffusive downgradient formulation, fluxes of conservative thermodynamic variables, the turbulence mixing timescale, and the condensation timescale, which is determined by the droplet spectrum. The results also suggest that the condensation timescale regulates the turbulence fields, as does the number concentration, because it affects the condensation fluctuation, which is highly correlated with the turbulence vertical motion. A saturation adjustment cloud model, which diagnoses liquid water content at its equilibrium level, instantly condenses (evaporates) all available water vapor (liquid water) surplus. Consequently, there is likely to be a systematic difference between the turbulence field resolved with this type of model and that with a supersaturation-based cloud scheme for which a finite condensation timescale applies.",

	Abstract = {Aerosol indirect effects have remained the largest uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Observational constraints on cloud lifetime effects are particularly challenging since it is difficult to separate aerosol effects from meteorological influences. Here we use three global climate models, including a multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF, to show that the dependence of the probability of precipitation on aerosol loading, termed the precipitation frequency susceptibility (S-pop), is a good measure of the liquid water path response to aerosol perturbation (lambda), as both S-pop and lambda strongly depend on the magnitude of autoconversion, a model representation of precipitation formation via collisions among cloud droplets. This provides a method to use satellite observations to constrain cloud lifetime effects in global climate models. S-pop in marine clouds estimated from CloudSat, MODIS and AMSR-E observations is substantially lower than that from global climate models and suggests a liquid water path increase of less than 5\% from doubled cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. This implies a substantially smaller impact on shortwave cloud radiative forcing over ocean due to aerosol indirect effects than simulated by current global climate models (a reduction by one-third for one of the conventional aerosol-climate models). Further work is needed to quantify the uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates of S-pop and to examine S-pop in high-resolution models. Citation: Wang, M., et al.

abstract="The primary objective of CFMIP is to inform future assessments of cloud feedbacks through improved understanding of cloud-climate feedback mechanisms and better evaluation of cloud processes and cloud feedbacks in climate models. However, the CFMIP approach is also increasingly being used to understand other aspects of climate change, and so a second objective has now been introduced, to improve understanding of circulation, regional-scale precipitation, and non-linear changes. CFMIP is supporting ongoing model inter-comparison activities by coordinating a hierarchy of targeted experiments for CMIP6, along with a set of cloud-related output diagnostics. CFMIP contributes primarily to addressing the CMIP6 questions ``How does the Earth system respond to forcing?'' and ``What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?'' and supports the activities of the WCRP Grand Challenge on Clouds, Circulation and Climate Sensitivity. A compact set of Tier 1 experiments is proposed for CMIP6 to address this question: (1) what are the physical mechanisms underlying the range of cloud feedbacks and cloud adjustments predicted by climate models, and which models have the most credible cloud feedbacks? Additional Tier 2 experiments are proposed to address the following questions. (2) Are cloud feedbacks consistent for climate cooling and warming, and if not, why? (3) How do cloudradiative effects impact the structure, the strength and the variability of the general atmospheric circulation in present and future climates? (4) How do responses in the climate system due to changes in solar forcing differ from changes due to CO2, and is the response sensitive to the sign of the forcing? (5) To what extent is regional climate change per CO2 doubling state-dependent (non-linear), and why? (6) Are climate feedbacks during the 20th century different to those acting on long-term climate change and climate sensitivity? (7) How do regional climate responses (e.g. in precipitation) and their uncertainties in coupled models arise from the combination of different aspects of CO2 forcing and sea surface warming? CFMIP also proposes a number of additional model outputs in the CMIP DECK, CMIP6 Historical and CMIP6 CFMIP experiments, including COSP simulator outputs and process diagnostics to address the following questions. 1. How well do clouds and other relevant variables simulated by models agree with observations? 2. What physical processes and mechanisms are important for a credible simulation of clouds, cloud feedbacks and cloud adjustments in climate models? 3. Which models have the most credible representations of processes relevant to the simulation of clouds? 4. How do clouds and their changes interact with other elements of the climate system?",

abstract="An investigation of the impact of the subgrid-scale variability of cloud liquid water on the autoconversion process as parameterized in a general circulation model is presented in this paper. For this purpose, a prognostic statistical probability density distribution (PDF) of the subgrid scale variability of cloud water is incorporated in a continuous autoconversion parameterization. Thus, the revised autoconversion rate is calculated by an integral of the autoconversion equation over the PDF of total water mixing ratio from the saturation vapor mixing ratio to the maximum of total water mixing ratio. An evaluation of the new autoconversion parameterization is carried out by means of one year simulations with the ECHAM5 climate model. The results indicate that the new autoconversion scheme causes an increase of the frequency of occurrence of high autoconversion rates and a decrease of low ones compared to the original scheme. This expected result is due to the emphasis on areas of high cloud liquid water in the new approach, and the non-linearity of the autoconversion with respect to liquid water mixing ratio. A similar trend as in the autoconversion is observed in the accretion process resulting from the coupling of both processes. As a consequence of the altered autoconversion, large-scale surface precipitation also shows a shift of occurrence from lower to higher rates. The vertically integrated cloud liquid water estimated by the model shows slight improvements compared to satellite data. Most importantly, the artificial tuning factor for autoconversion in the continuous parameterization could be reduced by almost an order of magnitude using the revised parameterization.",

abstract="This is the second of two observational papers examining drizzle in stratiform boundary layer clouds. Part I details the vertical and horizontal structure of cloud and drizzle parameters, including some bulk microphysical variables. In this paper, the focus is on the in situ size-resolved microphysical measurements, particularly of drizzle drops (r > 20 mu m). Layer-averaged size distributions of drizzle drops within cloud are shown to be well represented using either a truncated exponential or a truncated lognormal size distribution. The size-resolved microphysical measurements are used to estimate autoconversion and accretion rates by integration of the stochastic collection equation (SCE). These rates are compared with a number of commonly used bulk parameterizations of warm rain formation. While parameterized accretion rates agree well with those derived from the SCE initialized with observed spectra, the autoconversion rates seriously disagree in some cases. These disagreements need to be addressed in order to bolster confidence in large-scale numerical model predictions of the aerosol second indirect effect. Cloud droplet coalescence removal rates and mass and number fall rate relationships used in the bulk microphysical schemes are also compared, revealing some potentially important discrepancies. The relative roles of autoconversion and accretion are estimated by examination of composite profiles from the 12 flights. Autoconversion, although necessary for the production of drizzle drops, is much less important than accretion throughout the lower 80\% of the cloud layer in terms of the production of drizzle liquid water. The SCE calculations indicate that the autoconversion rate depends strongly upon the cloud droplet concentration N-d such that a doubling of N-d would lead to a reduction in autoconversion rate of between 2 and 4. Radar reflectivity-precipitation rate (Z-R) relationships suitable for radar use are derived and are shown to be significantly biased in some cases by the undersampling of large (r > 200 mu m) drops with the 2D-C probe. A correction based upon the extrapolation to larger sizes using the exponential size distribution changes the Z-R relationship, leading to the conclusion that consideration should be given to sampling issues when examining higher moments of the drop size distribution in drizzling stratiform boundary layer clouds.",

number="6",
pages="1605--1622",
abstract="The effects of aerosol on warm trade cumulus clouds are investigated using a large-eddy simulation with size-resolved cloud microphysics. It is shown that, as expected, increases in aerosols cause a reduction in precipitation and an increase in the cloud-averaged liquid water path (LWP). However, for the case under study, cloud fraction, cloud size, cloud-top height, and depth decrease in response to increasing aerosol concentration, contrary to accepted hypotheses associated with the second aerosol indirect effect. It is found that the complex responses of clouds to aerosols are determined by competing effects of precipitation and droplet evaporation associated with entrainment. As aerosol concentration increases, precipitation suppression tends to maintain the clouds and lead to higher cloud LWP, whereas cloud droplets become smaller and evaporate more readily, which tends to dissipate the clouds and leads to lower cloud fraction, cloud size, and depth. An additional set of experiments with higher surface latent heat flux, and hence higher LWP and drizzle rate, was also performed. Changes in cloud properties due to aerosols have the same trends as in the base runs, although the magnitudes of the changes are larger. Evidence for significant stabilization (or destabilization) of the subeloud layer due to drizzle is not found, mainly because drizzling clouds cover only a small fraction of the domain. It is suggested that cloud fraction may only increase with increasing aerosol loading for larger clouds that are less susceptible to entrainment and evaporation. Finally, it is noted that at any given aerosol concentration the dynamical variability in bulk cloud parameters such as LWP tends to be larger than the aerosol-induced changes in these parameters, indicating that the second aerosol indirect effect may be hard to measure in this cloud type. The variability in cloud optical depth is, however, dominated by changes in aerosol, rather than dynamics.",

	Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of aerosol on clouds, precipitation,
   and the organization of trade wind cumuli using large eddy simulations
   (LES). Results show that for this shallow-cumulus-under-stratocumulus
   case, cloud fraction increases with increasing aerosol as the aerosol
   number mixing ratio increases from 25 (domain-averaged surface
   precipitation rate similar to 0.65 mm day(-1)) to 100 mg(-1) (negligible
   surface precipitation). Further increases in aerosol result in a
   reduction in cloud fraction. It is suggested that opposing influences of
   aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation and aerosol-induced
   enhancement of evaporation are responsible for this nonmonotonic
   behavior. Under clean conditions (25 mg(-1)), drizzle is shown to
   initiate and maintain mesoscale organization of cumulus convection.
   Precipitation induces downdrafts and cold pool outflow as the cumulus
   cell develops. At the surface, the center of the cell is characterized
   by a divergence field, while the edges of the cell are zones of
   convergence. Convergence drives the formation and development of new
   cloud cells, leading to a mesoscale open cellular structure. These zones
   of new cloud formation generate new precipitation zones that continue to
   reinforce the cellular structure. For simulations with an aerosol
   concentration of 100 mg(-1) the cloud fields do not show any cellular
   organization. On average, no evidence is found for aerosol effects on
   the lifetime of these clouds, suggesting that cloud fraction response to
   changes in aerosol is tied to the frequency of convection and/or cloud

	Abstract = {The interaction of anthropogenic aerosols with radiation and clouds is the largest source of uncertainty in the radiative forcing of the climate during the industrial period. Here we apply novel techniques to diagnose the contributors to the shortwave (SW) effective radiative forcing (ERF) from aerosol-radiation-interaction (ERFari) and from aerosol cloud interaction (ERFaci) in experiments performed in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We find that the ensemble mean SW ERFari+aci of -1.40 +/- 0.56 W m(-2) comes roughly 25\% from ERFari (-0.35 +/- 0.20 W m(-2)) and 75\% from ERFaci (-1.04 +/- 0.67 W m(-2)). ERFari is made up of -0.62 +/- 0.30 W m(-2) due to aerosol scattering opposed by +0.26 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) due to aerosol absorption and is largest near emission sources. The ERFari from nonsulfate aerosols is +0.13 +/- 0.09 W m(-2), consisting of -0.15 +/- 0.11 W m(-2) of scattering and +0.29 +/- 0.15 W m(-2) of absorption. The change in clear-sky flux is a negatively biased measure of ERFari, as the presence of clouds reduces the magnitude and intermodel spread of ERFari by 40-50\%. ERFaci, which is large both near and downwind of emission sources, is composed of -0.99 +/- 0.54 W m(-2) from enhanced cloud scattering, with much smaller contributions from increased cloud amount and absorption. In models that allow aerosols to affect ice clouds, large increases in the optical depth of high clouds cause substantial longwave and shortwave radiative anomalies. Intermodel spread in ERFaci is dominated by differences in how aerosols increase cloud scattering, but even if all models agreed on this effect, over a fifth of the spread in ERFaci would remain due solely to differences in total cloud amount.},

abstract="One of the challenges in representing warm rain processes in global climate models (GCMs) is related to the representation of the subgrid variability of cloud properties, such as cloud water and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), and the effect thereof on individual precipitation processes such as autoconversion. This effect is conventionally treated by multiplying the resolved-scale warm rain process rates by an enhancement factor (E-q) which is derived from integrating over an assumed subgrid cloud water distribution. The assumed subgrid cloud distribution remains highly uncertain. In this study, we derive the subgrid variations of liquid-phase cloud properties over the tropical ocean using the satellite remote sensing products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and investigate the corresponding enhancement factors for the GCM parameterization of autoconversion rate. We find that the conventional approach of using only subgrid variability of cloud water is insufficient and that the subgrid variability of CDNC, as well as the correlation between the two, is also important for correctly simulating the autoconversion process in GCMs. Using the MODIS data which have near-global data coverage, we find that Eq shows a strong dependence on cloud regimes due to the fact that the subgrid variability of cloud water and CDNC is regime dependent. Our analysis shows a significant increase of Eq from the stratocumulus (Sc) to cumulus (Cu) regions. Furthermore, the enhancement factor E-N due to the subgrid variation of CDNC is derived from satellite observation for the first time, and results reveal several regions downwind of biomass burning aerosols (e. g., Gulf of Guinea, east coast of South Africa), air pollution (i. e., East China Sea), and active volcanos (e. g., Kilauea, Hawaii, and Ambae, Vanuatu), where the E-N is comparable to or even larger than E-q, suggesting an important role of aerosol in influencing the EN. MODIS observations suggest that the subgrid variations of cloud liquid water path (LWP) and CDNC are generally positively correlated. As a result, the combined enhancement factor, including the effect of LWP and CDNC correlation, is significantly smaller than the simple product of E-q center dot E-N. Given the importance of warm rain processes in understanding the Earth's system dynamics and water cycle, we conclude that more observational studies are needed to provide a better constraint on the warm rain processes in GCMs.",

	Abstract = {Observation-based studies have shown that the aerosol cloud lifetime effect or the increase of cloud liquid water path (LWP) with increased aerosol loading may have been overestimated in climate models. Here, we simulate shallow warm clouds on 27 May 2011 at the southern Great Plains (SGP) measurement site established by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program using a single-column version of a global climate model (Community Atmosphere Model or CAM) and a cloud resolving model (CRM). The LWP simulated by CAM increases substantially with aerosol loading while that in the CRM does not. The increase of LWP in CAM is caused by a large decrease of the autoconversion rate when cloud droplet number increases. In the CRM, the autoconversion rate is also reduced, but this is offset or even outweighed by the increased evaporation of cloud droplets near the cloud top, resulting in an overall decrease in LWP. Our results suggest that climate models need to include the dependence of cloud top growth and the evaporation/condensation process on cloud droplet number concentrations.},

abstract="The spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) changes has a large impact on the magnitude of cloud feedback. In this study, we seek a basic understanding of the dependence of cloud feedback on the spatial pattern of warming. Idealized experiments are carried out with an AGCM to calculate the change in global mean cloud-induced radiation anomalies (Delta R-cloud) in response to imposed surface warming/cooling in 74 individual localized oceanic ``patches''. Then the cloud feedback in response to a specific warming pattern can be approximated as the superposition of global cloud feedback in response to a temperature change in each region, weighted by the magnitude of the local temperature changes. When there is a warming in the tropical subsidence or extratropical regions, the local decrease of LCC results in a positive change in R-cloud. Conversely, warming in tropical ascent regions increases the free-tropospheric temperature throughout the tropics, thereby enhancing the inversion strength over remote regions and inducing positive global low-cloud cover (LCC) anomalies and negative R-cloud anomalies. The Green's function approach performs reasonably well in predicting the response of global mean Delta LCC and net Delta R-cloud, but poorly for shortwave and longwave components of Delta R-cloud due to its ineffectiveness in predicting middle and high cloud cover changes. The approach successfully captures the change of cloud feedback in response to time-evolving CO2-induced warming and captures the interannual variations in Delta R-cloud observed by CERES. The results highlight important nonlocal influences of SST changes on cloud feedback.",

CAM6 overestimates cloud occurrence and optical thickness while cloud droplet number concentrations are biased low, leading to excessive TOA reflected shortwave radiation.

Further investigation of these microphysical biases is needed for both models.}

abstract="The importance of the representation of cloud in a general circulation model is investigated by utilizing four different parameterization schemes for layer cloud in a low-resolution version of the general CirCulation model at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. The performance of each version of the model in terms of cloud and radiation is assessed in relation to satellite data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). Schemes that include a prognostic cloud water variable show some improvement on those with relative humidity-dependent cloud, but all still show marked differences from the ERBE data. The sensitivity of each of the versions of the model to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is investigated. Midlevel and lower-level clouds decrease when cloud is dependent on relative humidity, and this constitutes a strong positive feedback. When interactive cloud water is included, however, this effect is almost entirely compensated for by a negative feedback from the change of phase of cloud water from ice to water. Additional negative feedbacks are found when interactive radiative properties of cloud are included and these lead to an overall negative cloud feedback. The global warming produced with the four models then ranges from 5.4-degrees with a relative humidity scheme to 1.9-degrees-C with interactive cloud water and radiative properties. Improving the treatment of ice cloud based on observations increases the model's sensitivity slightly to 2.1-degrees-C. Using an energy balance model, it is estimated that the climate sensitivity using the relative humidity scheme along with the negative feedback from cloud radiative properties would be 2.8-degrees-C. Thus, 2.8-degrees-2.1-degrees-C appears to be a better estimate of the range of equilibrium response to a doubling of CO2.",

Aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds are important because of their fundamental role on sea ice loss and polar climate change, but very little is known about aerosol effects on these clouds. Here we provide the first analysis of the effects of aerosol emitted from ship stacks into mixed-phase clouds. Satellite observations of solar reflection in numerous ship tracks reveal that cloud albedo increases 5 times more in liquid clouds when polluted and persist 2 h longer than in mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that seeding mixed-phase clouds via shipping aerosol is unlikely to provide any significant counterbalancing solar radiative cooling effects in warming polar regions.",

abstract="Subkilometer processes are critical to the physics of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) but have been dependent on parameterizations in global model simulations. We thus report the strength of ACI in the Ultra-Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM), a multiscale climate model that uses coarse exterior resolution to embed explicit cloud-resolving models with enough resolution (250 m horizontal, 20 m vertical) to quasi-resolve subkilometer eddies. To investigate the impact on ACIs, UPCAM's simulations are compared to a coarser multiscale model with 4 km horizontal resolution. UPCAM produces cloud droplet number concentrations (N-d) and cloud liquid water path (LWP) values that are higher than the coarser model but equally plausible compared to observations. Our analysis focuses on the Northern Hemisphere (20-50 degrees N) oceans, where historical aerosol increases have been largest. We find similarities in the overall radiative forcing from ACIs in the two models, but this belies fundamental underlying differences. The radiative forcing from increases in LWP is weaker in UPCAM, whereas the forcing from increases in N-d is larger. Surprisingly, the weaker LWP increase is not due to a weaker increase in LWP in raining clouds, but a combination of weaker increase in LWP in nonraining clouds and a smaller fraction of raining clouds in UPCAM. The implication is that as global modeling moves toward finer than storm-resolving grids, nuanced model validation of ACI statistics conditioned on the existence of precipitation and good observational constraints on the baseline probability of precipitation will become key for tighter constraints and better conceptual understanding. Plain Language Summary How aerosol particles impact the climate through their interactions with clouds is a significant source of uncertainty in quantifying the drivers of climate change over the past hundred years. Global climate models have so far been heavily reliant on approximations of the physical processes that occur at subkilometer scales, even though processes at those scales are important for representing the physics behind aerosol-cloud interactions. To address this gap, we develop and run a multiscale global model that embeds a finer-scale model (250m in the horizontal and 20m in the vertical) within the columns of a coarser-resolution global model. A pair of simulations with preindustrial and present-day aerosol emissions is used to quantify the impact of human aerosol emissions. They show that the climate impact of resolving subkilometer resolutions is relatively small. However, this masks some key differences. The increase in cloud water with increasing aerosols is substantially weaker when subkilometer motions are resolved. Most of this weakening is due to a weaker response in nonraining clouds and there being fewer clouds that rain in the high-resolution model. The simulation results point to observations of specific processes that can help further constrain the impact of aerosols on clouds and climate.",

abstract="Global models are an essential tool for climate projections, but conventional coarse-resolution atmospheric general circulation models suffer from errors both in their parameterized cloud physics and in their representation of climatically important circulation features. A notable recent study by Terai et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020ms002274) documents a global model capable of reproducing the regime-based effect of aerosols on cloud liquid water path expected from observational evidence. This may represent a significant advance in cloud process fidelity in global models. Such models can be expected to give a better estimate of the effective radiative forcing of the climate. If this advance in cloud process representation can be matched by advances in the representation of circulation features such as monsoons, then such models may also be able to navigate the complex tangle between spatially heterogeneous aerosol-cloud interactions and regional circulation patterns. This tight link between aerosol and circulation results in anthropogenic perturbations of climate variables of societal importance, such as regional rainfall distributions. Upcoming global models with km-scale resolution may improve the regional circulation and be able to take advantage of the Terai et al. (2020, https://doi. org/10.1029/2020ms002274) improvement in cloud physics. If so, an era of significantly improved regional climate projection capabilities may soon dawn. If not, then the improvement in cloud physics might spur intensified efforts on problems in model dynamics. Either way, based on the rapid changes in aerosol emissions in the near future, learning to make reliable projections based on biased models is a skill that will not go out of style. Plain Language Summary Human activity releases particles into the atmosphere. Some of these particles are small enough to remain suspended in air, forming an ``aerosol.'' Aerosols interact with clouds to make them brighter or dimmer. Clouds are very good sunlight reflectors, so changing their properties even slightly results in large changes to how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth. Over time, this changes the rate at which the climate warms. It also affects the regional circulation, that is, recurring weather patterns at the regional scale. This is especially important to society when it affects regions that experience intense rainfall, such as the summer monsoon. If circulation patterns change, locations that used to experience intense rain may receive far less rain than they are used to, and vice versa. To predict how human activity will change regional rainfall in the future requires using models. Unfortunately, the models that are currently available struggle with both the interactions between aerosols and clouds and with some regional circulation features, so their regional predictions are not as reliable as society needs them to be. A recent study describes a model that appears to be much better at aerosol-cloud interactions than previous global models, potentially solving half the problem. Many groups are currently at work on a new generation of models that may be better at regional circulation, which would solve the other half, although it may be good to temper any optimism until this has actually been demonstrated. If these two advances can be combined within the same model, then that model will be able to provide a much more reliable estimate of future regional climate. But model development is hard and slow work, while aerosol emissions are changing rapidly, so it is also important to find ways to extract useful information from imperfect models.",

pages="2373--2423",
abstract="This paper reviews the current knowledge of the climatological, structural, and organizational aspects of stratocumulus clouds and the physical processes controlling them. More of Earth's surface is covered by stratocumulus clouds than by any other cloud type making them extremely important for Earth's energy balance, primarily through their reflection of solar radiation. They are generally thin clouds, typically occupying the upper few hundred meters of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), and they preferably occur in shallow PBLs that are readily coupled by turbulent mixing to the surface moisture supply. Thus, stratocumuli favor conditions of strong lower-tropospheric stability, large-scale subsidence, and a ready supply of surface moisture; therefore, they are common over the cooler regions of subtropical and midlatitude oceans where their coverage can exceed 50{\%} in the annual mean. Convective instability in stratocumulus clouds is driven primarily by the emission of thermal infrared radiation from near the cloud tops and the resulting turbulence circulations are enhanced by latent heating in updrafts and cooling in downdrafts. Turbulent eddies and evaporative cooling drives entrainment at the top of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL), which is stronger than it would be in the absence of cloud, and this tends to result in a deepening of the STBL over time. Many stratocumulus clouds produce some drizzle through the collision-coalescence process, but thicker clouds drizzle more readily, which can lead to changes in the dynamics of the STBL that favor increased mesoscale variability, stratification of the STBL, and in some cases cloud breakup. Feedbacks between radiative cooling, precipitation formation, turbulence, and entrainment help to regulate stratocumulus. Although stratocumulus is arguably the most well-understood cloud type, it continues to challenge understanding. Indeed, recent field studies demonstrate that marine stratocumulus precipitate more strongly, and entrain less, than was previously thought, and display an organizational complexity much larger than previously imagined. Stratocumulus clouds break up as the STBL deepens and it becomes more difficult to maintain buoyant production of turbulence through the entire depth of the STBL. Stratocumulus cloud properties are sensitive to the concentration of aerosol particles and therefore anthropogenic pollution. For a given cloud thickness, polluted clouds tend to produce more numerous and smaller cloud droplets, greater cloud albedo, and drizzle suppression. In addition, cloud droplet size also affects the time scale for evaporation-entrainment interactions and sedimentation rate, which together with precipitation changes can affect turbulence and entrainment. Aerosols are themselves strongly modified by physical processes in stratocumuli, and these two-way interactions may be a key driver of aerosol concentrations over the remote oceans. Aerosol-stratocumulus interactions are therefore one of the most challenging frontiers in cloud-climate research. Low-cloud feedbacks are also a leading cause of uncertainty in future climate prediction because even small changes in cloud coverage and thickness have a major impact on the radiation budget. Stratocumuli remain challenging to represent in climate models since their controlling processes occur on such small scales. A better understanding of stratocumulus dynamics, particularly entrainment processes and mesoscale variability, will be required to constrain these feedbacks.",

This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6–3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3–4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5–95\% ranges are 2.3–4.7 K, bounded by 2.0–5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

These simulations vary in their initial conditions for temperature, moisture, boundary-layer height, and aerosol concentration but share boundary conditions for surface fluxes and subsidence. Our approach is based on Gaussian-process emulation, a statistical technique related to machine learning. We succeed in building emulators that accurately predict simulated values of CF, A(C), and rCRE for given values of N and LWP. Emulator-derived susceptibilities partial derivative lnrCRE/partial derivative lnN and partial derivative lnrCRE/partial derivative lnLWP cover the nondrizzling, fully overcast regime as well as the drizzling regime with broken cloud cover. Theoretical results, which are limited to the nondrizzling regime, are reproduced.

Significantly lower concentrations (40 {\%}) of surface CCN concentration are measured when precipitation rates in 48 h back trajectories average above 1.2 mm d-1 in the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) product. The depletion of CCN concentration when precipitation rates are elevated is nearly twice as large in the ARM observations compared to E3SMv1 simulations. The model CCN concentration bias remains significant despite modifying the autoconversion and accretion rates in warm clouds. As the clouds in trajectories associated with larger surface-based CCN concentration advect away from Graciosa Island, they maintain higher values of droplet number concentrations (Nd) over multiple days in observations and E3SM simulations compared to trajectories that start with lower CCN concentrations. The response remains robust even after controlling for meteorological factors such as lower troposphere stability, the degree of cloud coupling with the surface, and island wake effects. E3SMv1 simulates a multi-day aerosol effect on clouds and a Twomey radiative effect that is within 30 {\%} of the ARM and satellite observations. However, the mean cloud droplet concentration is more than 2-3 times larger than in the observations. While Twomey radiative effects are similar amongst autoconversion and accretion sensitivity experiments, the liquid water path and cloud fraction adjustments are positive when using a regression model as opposed to negative when using the present-day minus pre-industrial aerosol emissions approach. This result suggests that tuning the autoconversion and accretion alone is unlikely to produce the desired aerosol susceptibilities in E3SMv1.",

abstract="Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) are considered to be the most uncertain driver of present-day radiative forcing due to human activities. The nonlinearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well-defined sources provide ``opportunistic experiments'' (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatiotemporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors. We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite datasets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change.",

abstract="The Twomey effect describes the radiative forcing associated with a change in cloud albedo due to an increase in anthropogenic aerosol emissions. It is driven by the perturbation in cloud droplet number concentration (Delta N-d, (ant)) in liquid-water clouds and is currently understood to exert a cooling effect on climate. The Twomey effect is the key driver in the effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions, but rapid adjustments also contribute. These adjustments are essentially the responses of cloud fraction and liquid water path to Delta N-d, (ant) ant and thus scale approximately with it. While the fundamental physics of the influence of added aerosol particles on the droplet concentration (N-d) is well described by established theory at the particle scale (micrometres), how this relationship is expressed at the large-scale (hundreds of kilometres) perturbation, Delta N-d, (ant), remains uncertain. The discrepancy between process under-standing at particle scale and insufficient quantification at the climate-relevant large scale is caused by co-variability of aerosol particles and updraught velocity and by droplet sink processes. These operate at scales on the order of tens of metres at which only localised observations are available and at which no approach yet exists to quantify the anthropogenic perturbation. Different atmospheric models suggest diverse magnitudes of the Twomey effect even when applying the same anthropogenic aerosol emission perturbation. Thus, observational data are needed to quantify and constrain the Twomey effect. At the global scale, this means satellite data. There are four key uncertainties in determining Delta N-d, (ant) namely the quantification of (i) the cloud-active aerosol - the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations at or above cloud base, (ii) N-d, (iii) the statistical approach for inferring the sensitivity of N-d to aerosol particles from the satellite data and (iv) uncertainty in the anthropogenic perturbation to CCN concentrations, which is not easily accessible from observational data. This review discusses deficiencies of current approaches for the different aspects of the problem and proposes several ways forward: in terms of CCN, retrievals of optical quantities such as aerosol optical depth suffer from a lack of vertical resolution, size and hygroscopicity information, non-direct relation to the concentration of aerosols, difficulty to quantify it within or below clouds, and the problem of insufficient sensitivity at low concentrations, in addition to retrieval errors. A future path forward can include utilising co-located polarimeter and lidar instruments, ideally including high-spectral-resolution lidar capability at two wavelengths to maximise vertically resolved size distribution information content. In terms of N-d, a key problem is the lack of operational retrievals of this quantity and the inaccuracy of the retrieval especially in broken-cloud regimes. As for the N-d-to-CCN sensitivity, key issues are the updraught distributions and the role of N-d sink processes, for which empirical assessments for specific cloud regimes are currently the best solutions. These considerations point to the conclusion that past studies using existing approaches have likely underestimated the true sensitivity and, thus, the radiative forcing due to the Twomey effect.",

Attempts to use observations to constrain the parameterizations of cloud processes in GCMs have failed to reduce the disagreement. We propose using observations sensitive to the relevant cloud processes rather than only to the atmospheric state and focusing on process realism in the absence of aerosol perturbations in addition to the process susceptibility to aerosols. We show that process-sensitive observations of precipitation can reduce the uncertainty on GCM estimates of rapid cloud adjustments to aerosols. The feasibility of an observational constraint depends on understanding the precipitation intensity spectrum in both observations and models and also on improving methods to compare the two.",

abstract="Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol-driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed-phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68{\%} confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of -1.6 to -0.6Wm(-2), or -2.0 to -0.4Wm(-2) with a 90{\%} likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial-era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds. Plain Language Summary Human activities emit into the atmosphere small liquid and solid particles called aerosols. Those aerosols change the energy budget of the Earth and trigger climate changes, by scattering and absorbing solar and terrestrial radiation and playing important roles in the formation of cloud droplets and ice crystals. But because aerosols are much more varied in their chemical composition and much more heterogeneous in their spatial and temporal distributions than greenhouse gases, their perturbation to the energy budget, called radiative forcing, is much more uncertain. This review uses traceable and arguable lines of evidence, supported by aerosol studies published over the past 40 years, to quantify that uncertainty. It finds that there are two chances out of three that aerosols from human activities have increased scattering and absorption of solar radiation by 14{\%} to 29{\%} and cloud droplet number concentration by 5 to 17{\%} in the period 2005-2015 compared to the year 1850. Those increases exert a radiative forcing that offsets between a fifth and a half of the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. The degree to which human activities affect natural aerosol levels, and the response of clouds, and especially ice clouds, to aerosol perturbations remain particularly uncertain.",

abstract="The radiative forcing from aerosols (particularly through their interaction with clouds) remains one of the most uncertain components of the human forcing of the climate. Observation-based studies have typically found a smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model simulations and were given preferential weighting in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty in the impact of aerosols on the climate. These reported discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating the components of aerosol forcing used in model and observational studies. Applying the observational decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on cloud properties. Cloud adjustments re-main a significant source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However, they are consistent with the uncertainty from observation-based methods, with the liquid water path adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50 {\%}. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be more equally weighted in future synthesis studies.",

abstract="The Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1, the atmospheric component of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model is described. The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km (similar to 0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to ``brute force'' tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models.

Physical, chemical, and biogeochemical processes treated within the atmospheric model are described, and pointers to previous and recent work are listed to provide additional information. The model is compared to present-day observations and evaluated for some important tests that provide information about what could happen to clouds and the environment as changes occur.

abstract="The cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide N-d, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth ((c)) cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78{\%} is inferred for pixel-level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1 degrees x1 degrees regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54{\%} assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. N-d uncertainty is dominated by errors in r(e), and therefore, improvements in r(e) retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the N-d retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing N-d data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of N-d data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative N-d estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high-quality ground-based observations are examined. Plain Language Summary Clouds have a very large influence on weather and climate. It is thus a prime task for satellite- and ground-based observations to measure clouds. For satellites and many other instruments this is done by remote sensingradiation is measured, and knowledge about clouds is inferred. Liquid water clouds consist of numerous droplets of order of 10m in size. A key quantity that describes clouds is the number of droplets in a given volume or the droplet number concentration. However, satellite observations of droplet number concentration are only emerging, and the quality of these observations is poorly known. This review fulfills two tasks, namely, (1) to quantify how uncertain the current way to observe droplet number concentrations from satellite is and (2) to propose ways toward better approaches. It is concluded that the current way to obtain cloud droplet number concentration works for homogeneous stratus and stratocumulus clouds, with, however, a substantial error of around 50{\%}. For cumulus clouds the observations are substantially worse. New avenues that are proposed for a better estimate of cloud droplet concentration exploit instruments that emit light (lidar) or microwaves (radar), and measure the reflected signal, or explore the polarization of light induced by clouds.",

pages="2765--2783",
abstract="Aerosol-cloud interactions continue to constitute a major source of uncertainty for the estimate of climate radiative forcing. The variation of aerosol indirect effects (AIE) in climate models is investigated across different dynamical regimes, determined by monthly mean 500 hPa vertical pressure velocity (omega(500)), lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and large-scale surface precipitation rate derived from several global climate models (GCMs), with a focus on liquid water path (LWP) response to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The LWP sensitivity to aerosol perturbation within dynamic regimes is found to exhibit a large spread among these GCMs. It is in regimes of strong large-scale ascent (omega(500)aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand < aEuro-a'25 hPa day(-1)) and low clouds (stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus) where the models differ most. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing is also found to differ significantly among different regimes. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing in ascending regimes is close to that in subsidence regimes, which indicates that regimes with strong large-scale ascent are as important as stratocumulus regimes in studying AIE. It is further shown that shortwave aerosol indirect forcing over regions with high monthly large-scale surface precipitation rate (> 0.1 mm day(-1)) contributes the most to the total aerosol indirect forcing (from 64 to nearly 100 {\%}). Results show that the uncertainty in AIE is even larger within specific dynamical regimes compared to the uncertainty in its global mean values, pointing to the need to reduce the uncertainty in AIE in different dynamical regimes.",

abstract="Previous global satellite studies into the indirect aerosol effect have relied on determining the sensitivity of derived Cloud Droplet Number Concentration (N-d) to co-located Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). These studies generally find a positive N-d sensitivity to AOD changes over ocean, but some find a negative sensitivity over land, in contrast to that predicted by models and theory. Here we investigate the N-d sensitivity to AOD in different cloud regimes, determined using a k-means clustering process on retrieved cloud properties. We find the strongest positive N-d sensitivity in the stratiform regimes over both land and ocean, providing the majority of the total sensitivity. The negative sensitivity previously observed over land is generated by the low cloud fraction regimes, suggesting that it is due to the difficulty of retrieving N-d at low cloud fractions. When considering a mean sensitivity, weighted by liquid cloud fraction to account for sampling biases, we find an increased sensitivity over land, in some regions becoming positive. This highlights the importance of regime based analysis when studying aerosol indirect effects. Citation: Gryspeerdt, E., and P.

abstract="The properties of clouds that may be observed by satellite instruments, such as optical thickness and cloud-top pressure, are only loosely related to the way clouds are represented in models of the atmosphere. One way to bridge this gap is through ``instrument simulators,'' diagnostic tools that map the model representation to synthetic observations so that differences can be interpreted as model error. But simulators may themselves be restricted by limited information or by internal assumptions. This paper considers the extent to which instrument simulators are able to capture essential differences between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), two similar but independent estimates of cloud properties. The authors review the measurements and algorithms underlying these two cloud climatologies, introduce a MOD IS simulator, and detail datasets developed for comparison with global models using ISCCP and MODIS simulators. In nature MODIS observes less midlevel cloudiness than ISCCP, consistent with the different methods used to determine cloud-top pressure: aspects of this difference are reproduced by the simulators. Differences in observed distributions of optical thickness, however, are not captured. The largest differences can be traced to different approaches to partly cloudy pixels, which MODIS excludes and ISCCP treats as homogeneous. These cover roughly 15{\%} of the planet and account for most of the optically thinnest clouds. Instrument simulators cannot reproduce these differences because there is no way to synthesize partly cloudy pixels. Nonetheless, MODIS and ISCCP observations are consistent for all but the optically thinnest clouds, and models can be robustly evaluated using instrument simulators by integrating over the robust subset of observations.",

abstract="Cloud microphysical observations collected in situ during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment within the Chile-Peru stratocumulus cloud deck during October-November 2008 were used to assess MODIS Level 2 cloud property retrievals. The in situ aircraft-derived cloud property values were constructed from the drop size distributions measured by the Cloud Droplet Probe (drop diameter <52 micron) and Two-Dimensional Cloud Probe (drop diameters up to 1600 micron) during 20 vertical profiles. Almost all of the MODIS cloud scenes were highly homogeneous. MODIS cloud optical thickness correlated well with the aircraft-derived value with a slight offset within instrumental/retrieval uncertainties. In contrast, the standard 2.1 micron-derived MODIS effective radius (r(e)) systematically exceeded the in situ cloud top r(e) by 15{\%}-20{\%}, for an absolute error that increased with droplet size. The individual effective radius retrievals at 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7 micron did not provide additional information on cloud vertical structure for our data sample. The secondarily derived MODIS liquid water path also exceeded the in situ value. A MODIS-derived cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) estimate agreed the best of the four MODIS variables with the aircraft observations. The analysis also highlighted a lack of agreement in published satellite-derived N-d values, despite drawing on the same sources. A best a priori formula choice for N-d is likely to vary regionally. Four sources of errors within the MODIS r(e) retrieval were investigated further: the cloud mode droplet size distribution breadth, the presence of a drizzle mode, above-cloud water vapor absorption, and sensor viewing angles. These processes combined conspired to explain most of the observed bias. The above-cloud water vapor paths were poorly specified, primarily because the cloud top heights are placed too high, and secondarily because the water vapor paths are unrealistic. Improvement of the above-cloud water vapor path specification can most easily and systematically improve the MODIS effective radius and liquid water path retrievals.",

The focus here is on tropical, low-level clouds, which have been identified as important for estimates of climate sensitivity. Investigating the distribution of the monthly mean vertical velocity and lower-tropospheric stability, the aquaplanets are seen to capture the core of the distribution of the more Earth-like configurations, whose distributions are, in turn, similar to that of reanalysis data. By conditionally sampling over these distributions, low-cloud regimes are defined, separating shallow cumulus convection from stratocumulus. Within each regime, the GCMs produce similar large-scale environments, yet disparate depictions of the clouds. Aquaplanets lack stratocumulus because of their zonally symmetric boundary conditions, but produce extensive trade-wind regions populated by shallow cumulus clouds just like those in the Earth-like setting. The analysis shows that aquaplanets can be compared with observations, just as well as the Earth-like configuration, with the added ability to focus on particular regimes without complications from geographical or temporal biases.",

abstract="Global satellite data are used to infer the droplet number concentration of marine boundary layer clouds. In a first step, two and a half years (July 2002 to December 2004) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, on board NASA's Aqua satellite) level 3 data estimates of cloud effective radius and optical thickness are used to derive cloud droplet number concentration N and cloud geometrical thickness H under the assumption of adiabatically stratified clouds. Theoretical error estimates show that for a liquid water path higher than 30 g/m(2) and a cloud fraction higher than 0.8, H (N) can be derived with a relative uncertainty of better than 20{\%} (80{\%}). To further validate the estimates of N and H, cloud liquid water path is calculated and compared to independent observations of cloud liquid water path from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), also on board Aqua. Good agreement between the two different data sets is found. In a second step, the global distribution of cloud droplet number concentration in stratiform boundary layer clouds is evaluated. The data are separated into observations that are likely to be drizzling and drizzle- free using published relations between drizzle rate and N and H. It is found that the mean droplet number concentration over remote Northern Hemisphere oceans is higher than over the southern oceans (64-89 cm(-3) in the Northern Hemisphere and 40-67 cm(-3) in the Southern Hemisphere). Leeward of the major continents cloud droplet number concentration is generally high with maximum values close to the coasts. On the Southern Hemisphere, especially over the east Pacific Ocean, microphysical conditions were almost constant through the entire observation period. Over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, the cloud microphysical variability appears to be strongly influenced by the dry biomass burning season in Africa.",

abstract="The plane-parallel model for the parameterization of clouds in global climate models is examined in order to estimate the effects of the vertical profile of the microphysical parameters on radiative transfer calculations for extended boundary layer clouds. The vertically uniform model is thus compared to the adiabatic stratified one. The validation of the adiabatic model is based on simultaneous measurements of cloud microphysical parameters in situ and cloud radiative properties from above the cloud layer with a multispectral radiometer. In particular, the observations demonstrate that the dependency of cloud optical thickness on cloud geometrical thickness is larger than predicted with the vertically uniform model and that it is in agreement with the prediction of the adiabatic one. Numerical simulations of the radiative transfer have been performed to establish the equivalence between the two models in terms of the effective radius. They show that the equivalent effective radius of a vertically uniform model is between 80{\%} and 100{\%} of the effective radius at the top of an adiabatic stratified model. The relationship depends, in fact, upon the cloud geometrical thickness and droplet concentration. Remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances in the visible and near infrared are then examined at the scale of a cloud system for a marine case and the most polluted case sampled during the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. The distributions of the measured values are significantly different between the two cases. This constitutes observational evidence of the aerosol indirect effect at the scale of a cloud system. Finally, the adiabatic stratified model is used to develop a procedure for the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness and cloud droplet number concentration from the measurements of cloud radiances. It is applied to the marine and to the polluted cases. The retrieved values of droplet concentration are significantly underestimated with respect to the values measured in situ. Despite this discrepancy the procedure is efficient at distinguishing the difference between the two cases.",

abstract="The authors showed that previous analyses which have estimated that the cloud water content decreases with increasing number of cloud droplets may have a negative bias due to variability in satellite data, thus underestimating aerosol-cloud-climate cooling. One major source of uncertainty in the cloud-mediated aerosol forcing arises from the magnitude of the cloud liquid water path (LWP) adjustment to aerosol-cloud interactions, which is poorly constrained by observations. Many of the recent satellite-based studies have observed a decreasing LWP as a function of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) as the dominating behavior. Estimating the LWP response to the CDNC changes is a complex task since various confounding factors need to be isolated. However, an important aspect has not been sufficiently considered: the propagation of natural spatial variability and errors in satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radius to estimates of CDNC and LWP. Here we use satellite and simulated measurements to demonstrate that, because of this propagation, even a positive LWP adjustment is likely to be misinterpreted as negative. This biasing effect therefore leads to an underestimate of the aerosol-cloud-climate cooling and must be properly considered in future studies.",

We use 5 years of geostationary satellite and surface retrievals at the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) eastern North Atlantic (ENA) site in the Azores to evaluate the representation of liquid cloud albedo susceptibility for overcast cloud scenes in the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1) and provide possible reasons for model-observation discrepancies.The overall distribution of surface 0.2 {\%} CCN concentration values is reasonably simulated, but simulated liquid water path (LWP) is lower than observed and layer mean droplet concentration (Nd) comparisons are highly variable depending on the Nd retrieval technique. E3SMv1's cloud albedo is greater than observed for given LWP and Nd values due to a lower cloud effective radius than observed. However, the simulated albedo response to Nd is suppressed due to a correlation between the solar zenith angle (SZA) and Nd created by the seasonal cycle that is not observed. Controlling for this effect by examining the cloud optical depth (COD) shows that E3SMv1's COD response to CCN concentration is greater than observed. For surface-based retrievals, this is only true after controlling for cloud adiabaticity because E3SMv1's adiabaticities are much lower than observed. Assuming a constant adiabaticity in surface retrievals as done in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) retrievals narrows the retrieved lnNd distribution, which increases the cloud albedo sensitivity to lnNd to match the TOA sensitivity.The greater sensitivity of COD to CCN is caused by a greater Twomey effect in which the sensitivity of Nd to CCN is greater than observed for TOA-retrieved Nd, and once model-observation cloud adiabaticity differences are removed, this is also true for surface-retrieved Nd. The LWP response to Nd in E3SMv1 is overall negative as observed. Despite reproducing the observed LWP-Nd relationship, observed clouds become much more adiabatic as Nd increases, while E3SMv1 clouds do not, associated with more heavily precipitating clouds that are partially but not completely caused by deeper clouds and weaker inversions in E3SMv1. These cloud property differences indicate that the negative LWP-Nd relationship is likely not caused by the same mechanisms in E3SMv1 and observations. The negative simulated LWP response also fails to mute the excessively strong Twomey effect, highlighting potentially important confounding factor effects that likely render the LWP-Nd relationship non-causal. Nd retrieval scales and assumptions, particularly related to cloud adiabaticity, contribute to substantial spreads in the model-observation comparisons, though enough consistency exists to suggest that aerosol activation, drizzle, and entrainment processes are critical areas to focus E3SMv1 development for improving the fidelity of aerosol-cloud interactions in E3SM.",

abstract = {Abstract The influence of aerosol particles on cloud reflectivity remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Commercial shipping constitutes a large and concentrated aerosol perturbation in a meteorological regime where clouds have a disproportionally large effect on climate. Yet, to date, studies have been unable to detect climatologically relevant cloud radiative effects from shipping, despite models indicating that the cloud response should produce a sizable negative radiative forcing (perturbation to Earth's energy balance). We attribute a significant increase in cloud reflectivity to enhanced cloud droplet number concentrations within a major shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic. Prevailing winds constrain emissions around the corridor, which cuts through a climatically important region of expansive low cloud cover. We use universal kriging, a classic geostatistical method, to estimate what cloud properties would have been in the absence of shipping. In the morning, cloud brightening is consistent with changes in microphysics alone, whereas in the afternoon, increases in cloud brightness from microphysical changes are offset by decreases in the total amount of cloud water. We calculate an effective radiative forcing within the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor of approximately −2 W/m2. Several years of data are required to identify a clear signal. Extrapolating our results globally, we calculate an effective radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions in low clouds of −1.0 W/m2 (95\% confidence interval: −1.6 to −0.4 W/m2). The unique setup in the southeast Atlantic could be an ideal test for the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models.},

In frequently occurring nonprecipitating stratocumulus, cloud amount can decrease through aerosol-enhanced cloud-top mixing. The climatological relevance of this effect is debated because ship exhaust only marginally reduces stratocumulus amount. By comparing detailed numerical simulations with satellite analyses, we show that ship-track studies cannot be generalized to estimate the climatological forcing of anthropogenic aerosol. The ship track-derived sensitivity of the radiative effect of nonprecipitating stratocumulus to aerosol overestimates their cooling effect by up to 200{\%}. The offsetting warming effect of decreasing stratocumulus amount needs to be taken into account if we are to constrain the cloud-mediated radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosol.",

abstract="A large fraction of the uncertainty around future global warming is due to the cooling effect of aerosol-liquid cloud interactions, and in particular to the elusive sign of liquid water path (LWP) adjustments to aerosol perturbations. To quantify this adjustment, we propose a causal approach that combines physical knowledge in the form of a causal graph with geostationary satellite observations of stratocumulus clouds. This allows us to remove confounding influences from large-scale meteorology and to disentangle counteracting physical processes (cloud-top entrainment enhancement and precipitation suppression due to aerosol perturbations) on different timescales. This results in weak LWP adjustments that are time-dependent (first positive then negative) and meteorological regime-dependent. More importantly, the causal approach reveals that failing to account for covariations of cloud droplet sizes and cloud depth, which are, respectively, a mediator and a confounder of entrainment and precipitation influences, leads to an overly negative aerosol-induced LWP response. This would result in an underestimation of the cooling influence of aerosol-cloud interactions.",

The problem is confounded by the fact that aerosol particles influence clouds locally and that averaging to larger spatial and/or temporal scales carries biases that depend on the heterogeneity and spatial correlation of the interacting fields and the nonlinearity of the responses Mimicking commonly applied satellite data analyses for calculation of albedo susceptibility S-o, we quantify S-o aggregation biases using an ensemble of 127 large eddy simulations of marine stratocumulus. We explore the cloud field properties that control this spatial aggregation bias and quantify the bias for a large range of shallow stratocumulus cloud conditions manifesting a variety of morphologies and ranges of cloud fractions. We show that S-o spatial aggregation biases can be on the order of hundreds of percent, depending on the methodology. Key uncertainties emanate from the typically applied adiabatic drop concentration Nd retrieval, the correlation between aerosol and cloud fields, and the extent to which averaging reduces the variance in cloud albedo A(c) and N-d. S-o biases are more often positive than negative and are highly correlated with biases in the liquid water path adjustment. Temporal aggregation biases are shown to offset spatial aggregation biases. Both spatial and temporal biases have significant implications for observationally based assessments of aerosol indirect effects and our inferences of underlying aerosol-cloud-radiation effects.",

abstract="The liquid water path (LWP) adjustment due to aerosol-cloud interactions in marine stratocumulus remains a considerable source of uncertainty for climate sensitivity estimates. An unequivocal attribution of LWP adjustments to changes in aerosol concentration from climatology remains difficult due to the considerable covariance between meteorological conditions alongside changes in aerosol concentrations. We utilise the susceptibility framework to quantify the potential change in LWP adjustment with boundary layer (BL) depth in subtropical marine stratocumulus. We show that the LWP susceptibility, i.e. the relative change in LWP scaled by the relative change in cloud droplet number concentration, in marine BLs triples in magnitude from -0.1 to -0.31 as the BL deepens from 300 to 1200m and deeper. We further find deep BLs to be underrepresented in pollution tracks, process modelling, and in situ studies of aerosolcloud interactions in marine stratocumulus. Susceptibility estimates based on these approaches are skewed towards shallow BLs of moderate LWP susceptibility. Therefore, extrapolating LWP susceptibility estimates from shallow BLs to the entire cloud climatology may underestimate the true LWP adjustment within subtropical stratocumulus and thus over-estimate the effective aerosol radiative forcing in this region. Meanwhile, LWP susceptibility estimates in deep BLs remain poorly constrained. While susceptibility estimates in shallow BLs are found to be consistent with process modelling studies, they overestimate pollution track estimates.",

abstract="The spatial variability of the microphysical fields in stratocumulus clouds is documented in this paper with statistics of droplet number concentration, droplet mean volume radius, and liquid water content for eight cases of the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. Statistics are calculated in five sublayers, from cloud base to cloud top, and they are utilized for deriving estimates of cloud optical thickness and liquid water path, by assuming either random or maximum overlap. The resulting in situ frequency distributions of optical thickness and liquid water path are validated against distributions of these two parameters retrieved from independent remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances. They are also used for testing parameterizations of optical thickness based on liquid water path and either the droplet effective radius or the cloud droplet number concentration. This unique data set of extensive, concomitant, and independent measurements of cloud microphysical and radiative properties is finally used for assessing the detectability of the aerosol indirect effect through examination of the correlation between cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius. If only cases of comparable values of geometrical thickness are considered, the correlation between optical thickness and effective radius is negative, as anticipated by Twomey [1977]. However, if the most polluted cases are also accounted for, the trend suggests a positive correlation. In fact, the most polluted cloud systems sampled during ACE-2 were slightly drier, hence thinner, than the marine and intermediate cases, hence producing a positive correlation between optical thickness and droplet effective radius. This study demonstrates that the monitoring of the aerosol indirect effect with satellite observations requires an independent retrieval of the liquid water path together with the cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius.",

abstract="General circulation models' (GCMs) estimates of the liquid water path adjustment to anthropogenic aerosol emissions differ in sign from other lines of evidence. This reduces confidence in estimates of the effective radiative forcing of the climate by aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci). The discrepancy is thought to stem in part from GCMs' inability to represent the turbulence-microphysics interactions in cloud-top entrainment, a mechanism that leads to a reduction in liquid water in response to an anthropogenic increase in aerosols. In the real atmosphere, enhanced cloud-top entrainment is thought to be the dominant adjustment mechanism for liquid water path, weakening the overall ERFaci. We show that the latest generation of GCMs includes models that produce a negative correlation between the present-day cloud droplet number and liquid water path, a key piece of observational evidence supporting liquid water path reduction by anthropogenic aerosols and one that earlier-generation GCMs could not reproduce. However, even in GCMs with this negative correlation, the increase in anthropogenic aerosols from preindustrial to present-day values still leads to an increase in the simulated liquid water path due to the parameterized precipitation suppression mechanism. This adds to the evidence that correlations in the present-day climate are not necessarily causal. We investigate sources of confounding to explain the noncausal correlation between liquid water path and droplet number. These results are a reminder that assessments of climate parameters based on multiple lines of evidence must carefully consider the complementary strengths of different lines when the lines disagree.",

abstract="Marine stratocumuli cool the Earth effectively due to their high reflectance of incoming solar radiation and persistent occurrence. The susceptibility of cloud albedo to droplet number concentration perturbations depends strongly on large-scale meteorological conditions. Studies focused on the meteorological dependence of cloud adjustments often overlook the covariability among meteorological factors and their geographical and temporal variability. We use 8 years of satellite observations sorted by day and geographical location to show the global distribution of marine low-cloud albedo susceptibility. We find an overall cloud brightening potential for most marine warm clouds, which is more pronounced over subtropical coastal regions. A weak cloud darkening potential in the annual mean is evident over the remote SE Pacific and SE Atlantic. We show that large-scale meteorological fields from the ERA5 reanalysis data, including lower-tropospheric stability, free-tropospheric relative humidity, sea surface temperature, and boundary layer depth, have distinct covariabilities over each of the eastern subtropical ocean basins where marine stratocumuli prevail. This leads to a markedly different annual cycle in albedo susceptibility over each basin. Moreover, we find that basin-specific regional relationships between key meteorological factors and albedo susceptibilities are absent in a global analysis. Our results stress the importance of considering the geographical distinctiveness of temporal meteorological covariability when scaling up the local-to-global response of cloud albedo to aerosol perturbations.",

abstract="This work documents version two of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 is a significant evolution from its predecessor E3SMv1, resulting in a model that is nearly twice as fast and with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics. We describe the physical climate model in its lower horizontal resolution configuration consisting of 110 km atmosphere, 165 km land, 0.5 degrees river routing model, and an ocean and sea ice with mesh spacing varying between 60 km in the mid-latitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles. The model performance is evaluated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations augmented with historical simulations as well as simulations to evaluate impacts of different forcing agents. The simulated climate has many realistic features of the climate system, with notable improvements in clouds and precipitation compared to E3SMv1. E3SMv1 suffered from an excessively high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 5.3 K. In E3SMv2, ECS is reduced to 4.0 K which is now within the plausible range based on a recent World Climate Research Program assessment. However, a number of important biases remain including a weak Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, deficiencies in the characteristics and spectral distribution of tropical atmospheric variability, and a significant underestimation of the observed warming in the second half of the historical period. An analysis of single-forcing simulations indicates that correcting the historical temperature bias would require a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol-related forcing. Plain Language Summary The U.S. Department of Energy recently released version two of its Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). E3SMv2 experienced a significant evolution in many of its model components (most notably the atmosphere and sea ice models), and its supporting software infrastructure. In this work, we document the computational performance of E3SMv2 and analyze its ability to reproduce the observed climate. To accomplish this, we utilize the standard Diagnosis and Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments augmented with historical simulations for the period 1850-2015. We find that E3SMv2 is nearly twice as fast as its predecessor and more accurately reproduces the observed climate in a number of metrics, most notably clouds and precipitation. We also find that the model's simulated response to increasing carbon dioxide (the equilibrium climate sensitivity) is much more realistic. Unfortunately, E3SMv2 underestimates the global mean surface temperature compared to observations during the second half of historical period. Using sensitivity experiments, where forcing agents (carbon dioxide, aerosols) are selectively disabled in the model, we determine that correcting this problem would require a strong reduction in the impact of aerosols.",

abstract="Realistic simulation of the Earth's mean-state climate remains a major challenge, and yet it is crucial for predicting the climate system in transition. Deficiencies in models' process representations, propagation of errors from one process to another, and associated compensating errors can often confound the interpretation and improvement of model simulations. These errors and biases can also lead to unrealistic climate projections and incorrect attribution of the physical mechanisms governing past and future climate change. Here we show that a significantly improved global atmospheric simulation can be achieved by focusing on the realism of process assumptions in cloud calibration and subgrid effects using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1). The calibration of clouds and subgrid effects informed by our understanding of physical mechanisms leads to significant improvements in clouds and precipitation climatology, reducing common and long-standing biases across cloud regimes in the model. The improved cloud fidelity in turn reduces biases in other aspects of the system. Furthermore, even though the recalibration does not change the global mean aerosol and total anthropogenic effective radiative forcings (ERFs), the sensitivity of clouds, precipitation, and surface temperature to aerosol perturbations is significantly reduced. This suggests that it is possible to achieve improvements to the historical evolution of surface temperature over EAMv1 and that precise knowledge of global mean ERFs is not enough to constrain historical or future climate change. Cloud feedbacks are also significantly reduced in the recalibrated model, suggesting that there would be a lower climate sensitivity when it is run as part of the fully coupled E3SM. This study also compares results from incremental changes to cloud microphysics, turbulent mixing, deep convection, and subgrid effects to understand how assumptions in the representation of these processes affect different aspects of the simulated atmosphere as well as its response to forcings. We conclude that the spectral composition and geographical distribution of the ERFs and cloud feedback, as well as the fidelity of the simulated base climate state, are important for constraining the climate in the past and future.",

abstract="Quantification of the radiative adjustment of marine low clouds to aerosol perturbations, regionally and globally, remains the largest source of uncertainty in assessing current and future climate. One of the important steps towards quantifying the role of aerosol in modifying cloud radiative properties is to quantify the susceptibility of cloud albedo and liquid water path (LWP) to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentration (N-d). We use 10 years of spaceborne observations from the polar-orbiting Aqua satellite to quantify the albedo susceptibility of marine low clouds to Nd perturbations over the northeast (NE) Pacific stratocumulus (Sc) region. Mutual information analysis reveals a dominating control of cloud state (e.g., LWP and N-d) on low-cloud albedo susceptibility, relative to the meteorological states that drive these cloud states. Through a LWP-Nd space decomposition of albedo susceptibilities, we show clear separation among susceptibility regimes (brightening or darkening), consistent with previously established mechanisms through which aerosol modulates cloud properties. These regimes include (i) thin non-precipitating clouds (LWP < 55 g m(-2)) that exhibit brightening (occurring 37 {\%} of the time), corresponding to the Twomey effect; (ii) thicker non-precipitating clouds, corresponding to entrainment-driven negative LWP adjustments that manifest as a darkening regime (36 {\%} of the time); and (iii) another brightening regime (22 {\%} of the time) consisting of mostly precipitating clouds, corresponding to precipitation-suppression LWP positive adjustments. Overall, we find an annual-mean regional low-cloud brightening potential of 20.8 +/- 2.68 W m(-2 )ln(N-d)(-1), despite an overall negative LWP adjustment for non-precipitating marine stratocumulus, owing to the high occurrence of the Twomey-brightening regime. Over the NE Pacific, clear seasonal covariabilities among meteorological factors related to the large-scale circulation are found to play an important role in grouping conditions favorable for each susceptibility regime. When considering the covarying meteorological conditions, our results indicate that for the northeastern Pacific stratocumulus, clouds that exhibit the strongest brightening potential occur most frequently within shallow marine boundary layers over a cool ocean surface with a stable atmosphere and a dry free troposphere above. Clouds that exhibit a darkening potential associated with negative LWP adjustments occur most frequently within deep marine boundary layers in which the atmospheric instability and the ocean surface are not strong and warm enough to produce frequent precipitation. Cloud brightening associated with warm-rain suppression is found to preferably occur either under unstable atmospheric conditions or humid free-tropospheric conditions that co-occur with a warm ocean surface.",

abstract="Anthropogenic aerosols are hypothesized to enhance planetary albedo and offset some of the warming due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere. Aerosols can enhance the coverage, reflectance, and lifetime of warm low-level clouds. However, the relationship between cloud lifetime and aerosol concentration has been challenging to measure from polar orbit-ing satellites. We estimate two timescales relating to the for-mation and persistence of low-level clouds over 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial domains using multiple years of geostationary satellite observa-tions provided by the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Synoptic (SYN) product. Lagrangian trajectories span-ning several days along the classic stratus-to-cumulus transition zone are stratified by aerosol optical depth and meteorology. Clouds forming in relatively polluted trajectories tend to have lighter precipitation rates, longer average lifetime, and higher cloud albedo and cloud fraction compared with unpolluted tra-jectories. While liquid water path differences are found to be negligible, we find direct evidence of increased planetary albedo primarily through increased drop concentration (Nd) and cloud fraction, with the caveat that the aerosol influence on cloud fraction is positive only for stable atmospheric conditions. While the increase in cloud fraction can be large typically in the beginning of trajectories, the Twomey effect accounts for the bulk (roughly 3/4) of the total aerosol indirect radiative forcing estimate.",

abstract="Aerosol-cloud interactions represent the leading uncertainty in our ability to infer climate sensitivity from the observational record. The forcing from changes in cloud albedo driven by increases in cloud droplet number (Nd) (the first indirect effect) is confidently negative and has narrowed its probable range in the last decade, but the sign and strength of forcing associated with changes in cloud macrophysics in response to aerosol (aerosol-cloud adjustments) remain uncertain. This uncertainty reflects our inability to accurately quantify variability not associated with a causal link flowing from the cloud microphysical state to the cloud macrophysical state. Once variability associated with meteorology has been removed, covariance between the liquid water path (LWP) averaged across cloudy and clear regions (here characterizing the macrophysical state) and Nd (characterizing the microphysical) is the sum of two causal pathways linking Nd to LWP: Nd altering LWP (adjustments) and precipitation scavenging aerosol and thus depleting Nd. Only the former term is relevant to constraining adjustments, but disentangling these terms in observations is challenging. We hypothesize that the diversity of constraints on aerosol-cloud adjustments in the literature may be partly due to not explicitly characterizing covariance flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. Here, we restrict our analysis to the regime of extratropical clouds outside of low-pressure centers associated with cyclonic activity. Observations from MAC-LWP (Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path) and MODIS are compared to simulations in the Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1). The meteorological predictors of LWP are found to be similar between the model and observations. There is also agreement with previous literature on cloud-controlling factors finding that increasing stability, moisture, and sensible heat flux enhance LWP, while increasing subsidence and sea surface temperature decrease it. A simulation where cloud microphysics are insensitive to changes in Nd is used to characterize covariance between Nd and LWP that is induced by factors other than aerosolcloud adjustments. By removing variability associated with meteorology and scavenging, we infer the sensitivity of LWP to changes in Nd. Application of this technique to UM GA7.1 simulations reproduces the true model adjustment strength. Observational constraints developed using simulated covariability not induced by adjustments and observed covariability between Nd and LWP predict a 25 {\%}-30 {\%} overestimate by the UM GA7.1 in LWP change and a 30 {\%}-35 {\%} overestimate in associated radiative forcing.",

abstract="While most observations indicate well-buffered clouds to aerosol perturbations, global models do not. Among the suggested mechanisms for this discrepancy is the models' lack of connections between cloud droplet size and two processes that can contribute to reduced cloudiness when droplets become more numerous and smaller: evaporation and entrainment. In this study, we explore different implementations of size-dependent evaporation and entrainment in the global atmospheric model CAM5.3-Oslo. We study their impact on the preindustrial-to-present day change in liquid water path (LWPPD-PI) and the corresponding aerosol indirect effect (AIE(PD-PI)). Impacts of the 2014-2015 fissure eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, are also presented. Our entrainment modifications only have a moderate effect on AIE(PD-PI) (changes from -1.07 W m(-2) to -0.98 W m(-2)), and a small impact on the signal from the Holuhraun eruption compared to other suggested compensating mechanisms. Simulations with added size-dependent evaporation in the top of the stratiform clouds also show small evaporation differences between PI and PD. Moderate changes in AIE(PD-PI) were achieved when also including an entrainment feedback to the evaporation changes, mixing air between the cloudtop layer and the layer above. These changes were not associated with the size dependency, but changes in the cloud susceptibility to aerosols in both PI and PD when adding evaporation. We find that increased evaporation of smaller droplets at stratiform cloud tops can reduce LWP, but can increase LWP in some areas due to enhanced shallow convection caused by destabilization.",

LES allows for a faster and more holistic study of the parameter space, but LES is sensitive to details of its formulation because the energetics are tied to unresolved processes in the cloud top region. One way to assess this sensitivity is through field studies. Another way is through DNS. In particular, DNS can be used to test the hypothesis that LES, even with an inadequate representation of the physics of cloud top entrainment, properly quantifies the sensitivity of cloud-topped boundary layers to changing environmental conditions. We support this argument by contrasting theoretical aspects of both techniques, by presenting first DNS results of a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer and discussing their convergence toward Reynolds number similarity, and by showing the consistency of DNS results with LES results and field measurements.",

abstract="Cloud properties from both ground-based as well as from geostationary passive satellite observations have been used previously for diagnosing aerosol-cloud interactions. In this investigation, a 2-year data set together with four selected case studies are analyzed with the aim of evaluating the consistency and limitations of current ground-based and satellite-retrieved cloud property data sets. The typically applied adiabatic cloud profile is modified using a sub-adiabatic factor to account for entrainment within the cloud. Based on the adiabatic factor obtained from the combination of ground-based cloud radar, ceilometer and microwave radiometer, we demonstrate that neither the assumption of a completely adiabatic cloud nor the assumption of a constant sub-adiabatic factor is fulfilled (mean adiabatic factor 0.63 +/- 0.22). As cloud adiabaticity is required to estimate the cloud droplet number concentration but is not available from passive satellite observations, an independent method to estimate the adiabatic factor, and thus the influence of mixing, would be highly desirable for global-scale analyses. Considering the radiative effect of a cloud described by the sub-adiabatic model, we focus on cloud optical depth and its sensitivities. Ground-based estimates are here compared vs. cloud optical depth retrieved from the Meteosat SEVIRI satellite instrument resulting in a bias of -4 and a root mean square difference of 16. While a synergistic approach based on the combination of ceilometer, cloud radar and microwave radiometer enables an estimate of the cloud droplet concentration, it is highly sensitive to radar calibration and to assumptions about the moments of the droplet size distribution. Similarly, satellite-based estimates of cloud droplet concentration are uncertain. We conclude that neither the ground-based nor satellite-based cloud retrievals applied here allow a robust estimate of cloud droplet concentration, which complicates its use for the study of aerosol-cloud interactions.",

abstract="Cloud water sedimentation and drizzle in a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer are the focus of an intercomparison of large-eddy simulations. The context is an idealized case study of nocturnal stratocumulus under a dry inversion, with embedded pockets of heavily drizzling open cellular convection. Results from 11 groups are used. Two models resolve the size distributions of cloud particles, and the others parameterize cloud water sedimentation and drizzle. For the ensemble of simulations with drizzle and cloud water sedimentation, the mean liquid water path (LWP) is remarkably steady and consistent with the measurements, the mean entrainment rate is at the low end of the measured range, and the ensemble-average maximum vertical wind variance is roughly half that measured. On average, precipitation at the surface and at cloud base is smaller, and the rate of precipitation evaporation greater, than measured. Including drizzle in the simulations reduces convective intensity, increases boundary layer stratification, and decreases LWP for nearly all models. Including cloud water sedimentation substantially decreases entrainment, decreases convective intensity, and increases LWP for most models. In nearly all cases, LWP responds more strongly to cloud water sedimentation than to drizzle. The omission of cloud water sedimentation in simulations is strongly discouraged, regardless of whether or not precipitation is present below cloud base.",

abstract="This study presents an intercomparison of single-column model simulations of a nocturnal heavily drizzling marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. Initial conditions and forcings are based on nocturnal flight observations off the coast of California during the DYCOMS-II field experiment. Differences in turbulent and microphysical parameterizations between models were isolated by slightly idealizing and standardizing the specification of surface and radiative fluxes. For most participating models, the case was run at both typical operational vertical resolution of about 100 m and also at high vertical resolution of about 10 m. As in prior stratocumulus intercomparisons, the simulations quickly develop considerable scatter in liquid water path (LWP) between models. However, the simulated dependence of cloud base drizzle fluxes on LWP in most models is broadly consistent with recent observations. Sensitivity tests with drizzle turned off show that drizzle substantially decreases LWP for many models. The sensitivity of entrainment rate to drizzle is more muted. Simulated LWP and entrainment are also sensitive to the inclusion of cloud droplet sedimentation. Many models underestimate the fraction of drizzle that evaporates below cloud base, which may distort the simulated feedbacks of drizzle on turbulence, entrainment, and LWP.",

abstract="Marine low clouds strongly cool the planet. How this cooling effect will respond to climate change is a leading source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the planetary warming resulting from CO2 doubling. Here, we observationally constrain this low cloud feedback at a near-global scale. Satellite observations are used to estimate the sensitivity of low clouds to interannual meteorological perturbations. Combined with model predictions of meteorological changes under greenhouse warming, this permits quantification of spatially resolved cloud feedbacks. We predict positive feedbacks from midlatitude low clouds and eastern ocean stratocumulus, nearly unchanged trade cumulus and a near-global marine low cloud feedback of 0.19 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) K-1 (90{\%} confidence). These constraints imply a moderate climate sensitivity (similar to 3 K). Despite improved midlatitude cloud feedback simulation by several current-generation climate models, their erroneously positive trade cumulus feedbacks produce unrealistically high climate sensitivities. Conversely, models simulating erroneously weak low cloud feedbacks produce unrealistically low climate sensitivities.",

abstract="Cloud feedbacks are a leading source of uncertainty in the climate sensitivity simulated by global climate models (GCMs). Low-latitude boundary-layer and cumulus cloud regimes are particularly problematic, because they are sustained by tight interactions between clouds and unresolved turbulent circulations. Turbulence-resolving models better simulate such cloud regimes and support the GCM consensus that they contribute to positive global cloud feedbacks. Large-eddy simulations using sub-100m grid spacings over small computational domains elucidate marine boundary-layer cloud response to greenhouse warming. Four observationally supported mechanisms contribute: 'thermodynamic' cloudiness reduction from warming of the atmosphere-ocean column, 'radiative' cloudiness reduction from CO2 and H2O-induced increase in atmospheric emissivity aloft, 'stability-induced' cloud increase fromincreased lower tropospheric stratification, and 'dynamical' cloudiness increase from reduced subsidence. The cloudiness reduction mechanisms typically dominate, giving positive shortwave cloud feedback. Cloud-resolving models with horizontal grid spacings of a few kilometres illuminate how cumulonimbus cloud systems affect climate feedbacks. Limited-area simulations and superparameterized GCMs show upward shift and slight reduction of cloud cover in a warmer climate, implying positive cloud feedbacks. A global cloud-resolving model suggests tropical cirrus increases in a warmer climate, producing positive longwave cloud feedback, but results are sensitive to subgrid turbulence and ice microphysics schemes.",

These budgets are used to estimate a mean diurnal cycle of entrainment and, by diagnosing the fluxes of humidity and liquid water static energy necessary to maintain a mixed-layer structure, of buoyancy flux. Although the entrainment rates suggested by each of the budgets have significant uncertainty, the various methods are consistent in predicting a 6-day mean entrainment rate of 4 +/- 1 mm s(-1), with higher values at night and very little entrainment around local noon. The diurnal cycle of buoyancy flux suggests that drizzle, while only a small term in the boundary layer moisture budget, significantly reduces subcloud buoyancy flux and may induce weak decoupling of surface and cloud-layer turbulence during the earl), morning hours, a structure that is maintained throughout the day by shortwave warming.

In particular, the ways in which varied forms of moist convection communicate with remote parts of the flow through mechanisms other than the rearrangement of fluid parcels are emphasized. These include radiative, gravity wave, and/or microphysical (precipitation) processes. For each regime, basic aspects of its phenomenology are presented along with theoretical frameworks that have arisen to help rationalize the phenomenology.

abstract="In a quest to represent the Earth system, climate models have become more and more complex. This generates problems, for example, hindering model interpretability. This study contributes to a regain of model understanding and proposes simplifications to decrease scheme complexity. We reflect on the reasons for model complexity and the problems it generates or deepens, connecting perspectives from atmospheric science and the philosophy of climate science. Using an emulated perturbed parameter ensemble of the cloud microphysics (CMP) process efficiencies, we investigate the sensitivity of the model to process perturbations. The sensitivity analysis characterizes the scheme and model behavior, contrasting it to physical process understanding as well as an alternative CMP formulation (comparing the 2M (Lohmann et al., 2007, ) to the P3 scheme (Morrison {\&} Milbrandt, 2015, ; Dietlicher et al., 2018, )). For the 2M scheme, ice crystal autoconversion dominates the model sensitivity in the ice phase. The P3 scheme removes this artificial process and thus shows more balanced sensitivities. Model behavior sometimes aligns with process understanding, but many process sensitivities are masked by other more dominant processes or the model finally responds differently due to adjustments. We identify processes that the model is not sensitive to and test their simplification. For example, heterogeneous freezing or secondary ice production are drastically simplifiable. Depending on one's modeling vision one may interpret this study's findings as pointing to simplification potential in the CMP scheme or the need for process representation improvements where the model behavior does not tally with our physical understanding.",

abstract="Lagrangian transitions in mesoscale cellular convective (MCC) clouds beginning as closed cell MCC and transitioning to open cells or disorganized but cellular MCC are explored on timescales from 12 to 72 hr. Potential drivers of MCC transitions are shown to act on multiple timescales. Closed-to-open MCC cloud transitions are preceded by strong surface winds and large moisture fluxes at lead times of up to 72 hr; and by high cloud water content, reduced cloud drop concentrations, and intense rain rates at lead times of 12-36 hr. The relationship between intense rain and the formation of open cells is consistent with a cold pool convergence mechanism. A Lagrangian analysis shows that anomalously strong surface winds are associated with higher rain rates as well as subsequent increases in rain rates through modifications to moisture flux and content in the boundary layer. The closed-open MCC transition contrasts with the closed-to-disorganized transition which at long lead times is associated with warm sea surface temperature and at diurnal-scale lead times is associated with variables related to cloud top entrainment drying such as a deepening boundary layer, weakening subsidence and inversion strength, and a drier free troposphere. A conceptual model is proposed where excess boundary layer moisture associated with wind breaks up stratocumulus through the closed-to-open transition, while excess dry-air entrainment at cloud top breaks up stratocumulus through the closed-to-disorganized transition.",

abstract="The persistent and growing spread in effective climate sensitivity (ECS) across global climate models necessitates rigorous evaluation of their cloud feedbacks. Here we evaluate several cloud feedback components simulated in 19 climate models against benchmark values determined via an expert synthesis of observational, theoretical, and high-resolution modeling studies. We find that models with smallest feedback errors relative to these benchmark values generally have moderate total cloud feedbacks (0.4-0.6 W m(-2) K-1) and ECS (3-4 K). Those with largest errors generally have total cloud feedback and ECS values that are too large or too small. Models tend to achieve large positive total cloud feedbacks by having several cloud feedback components that are systematically biased high rather than by having a single anomalously large component, and vice versa. In general, better simulation of mean-state cloud properties leads to stronger but not necessarily better cloud feedbacks. The Python code base provided herein could be applied to developmental versions of models to assess cloud feedbacks and cloud errors and place them in the context of other models and of expert judgment in real-time during model development. Plain Language Summary Climate models strongly disagree with each other regarding how much warming will occur in response to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is mainly because they disagree on the response of clouds to warming-a process known as the cloud feedback that can amplify or dampen warming initially caused by carbon dioxide. In this study, we compare many models' cloud feedbacks to those that have been determined by a recent expert assessment of the literature. We find that the models whose cloud feedbacks most strongly disagree with expert assessment tend to have more extreme cloud feedbacks and hence warm too much or too little in response to carbon dioxide. The models with total cloud feedbacks that are too large do not have a single massive feedback component but rather several components that are larger than in other models. Models that simulate current-climate clouds that look more like those in nature also simulate stronger amplifying cloud feedbacks, but doing a better job at simulating current-climate clouds does not, in general, guarantee a better simulation of cloud feedbacks.",

abstract="Stratocumulus clouds in the marine boundary layer cover a large fraction of ocean surface and play an important role in the radiative energy balance of the Earth system. Simulating these clouds in Earth system models (ESMs) has proven to be extremely challenging, in part because cloud microphysical processes such as the autoconversion of cloud water into precipitation occur at scales much smaller than typical ESM grid sizes. An accurate autoconversion parameterization needs to account for not only the local microphysical process (e.g., the dependence on cloud water content q(c) and cloud droplet number concentration N-c) but also the subgrid-scale variability of the cloud properties that determine the process rate. Accounting for subgrid-scale variability is often achieved by the introduction of a so-called enhancement factor E. Previous studies of E for autoconversion have focused more on its dependence on cloud regime and ESM grid size, but they have largely overlooked the vertical dependence of E within the cloud. In this study, we use a large-eddy simulation (LES) model, initialized and constrained with in situ and surface-based measurements from a recent airborne field campaign, to characterize the vertical dependence of the horizontal variation of q(c) in stratocumulus clouds and the implications for E. Similar to our recent observational study (Zhang et al., 2021), we found that the inverse relative variance of q(c), an index of horizontal homogeneity, generally increases from cloud base upward through the lower two-thirds of the cloud and then decreases in the uppermost one-third of the cloud. As a result, E decreases from cloud base upward and then increases towards the cloud top. We apply a decomposition analysis to the LES cloud water field to understand the relative roles of the mean and variances of q(c) in determining the vertical dependence of E. Our analysis reveals that the vertical dependence of the horizontal q(c) variability and enhancement factor E is a combined result of condensational growth throughout the lower portion of the cloud and entrainment mixing at cloud top. The findings of this study indicate that a vertically dependent E should be used in ESM autoconversion parameterizations.",

The simulations follow trajectories of the boundary layer flow. They track the formation and evolution of a pocket of open cells (POC) underneath a biomass burning aerosol layer in the free troposphere. The simulations reproduce the evolution of observed stratocumulus cloud morphology, cloud optical depth, and cloud drop effective radius, and capture the timing of the cloud state transition from closed to open cells seen in the satellite imagery on the three considered trajectories. They reproduce a biomass burning aerosol layer identified by the in-situ aircraft measurements above the inversion of the POC. Entrainment of aerosol from the biomass burning layer into the POC is limited to the extent of having no impact on cloud- or boundary layer properties, in agreement with the CLARIFY observations. The two-moment bin microphysics scheme used in the simulations reproduces the in-situ cloud microphysical properties reasonably well. A two-moment bulk microphysics scheme reproduces the satellite observations in the non-precipitating closed-cell state, but overestimates liquid water path and cloud optical depth in the precipitating open-cell state due to insufficient surface precipitation. A boundary layer cold and dry bias occurring in LES can be counteracted by reducing the grid aspect ratio and by tightening the large scale wind speed nudging towards the surface.",

The US Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility recently initiated the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) ARM Symbiotic Simulation and Observation (LASSO) activity focused on shallow convection at ARM's Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory in Oklahoma, USA. LASSO is designed to overcome an oft shared difficulty of bridging the gap from point-based measurements to scales relevant for model parameterization development, and it provides an approach to add value to observations through modeling. LASSO is envisioned to be useful to modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists needing information relevant to cloud processes. LASSO does so by combining a suite of observations, LES inputs and outputs, diagnostics, and skill scores into data bundles that are freely available, and by simplifying user access to the data to speed scientific inquiry. The combination of relevant observations with observationally constrained LES output provides detail that gives context to the observations by showing physically consistent connections between processes based on the simulated state. A unique approach for LASSO is the generation of a library of cases for days with shallow convection combined with an ensemble of LES for each case. The library enables researchers to move beyond the single-case-study approach typical of LES research. The ensemble members are produced using a selection of different large-scale forcing sources and spatial scales. Since large-scale forcing is one of the most uncertain aspects of generating the LES, the ensemble informs users about potential uncertainty for each date and increases the probability of having an accurate forcing for each case.",

Consequently, the more realistic models simulate more positive shortwave (SW) feedback (Delta CRE/Delta SST = 2.60 +/- 1.13 W m(-2) K-1) than the less realistic models (Delta CRE/Delta SST = 0.87 +/- 2.63 W m(-2) K-1), in better agreement with the observations (Delta CRE/Delta SSTobs = 3 +/- 0.26 W m(-2) K-1), although slightly underestimated. The ability of the models to represent moist processes within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and produce persistent stratocumulus (Sc) decks appears crucial to replicating the observed relationship between clouds, radiation and surface temperature. This relationship is different depending on the type of low clouds in the observations. Over stratocumulus regions, cloud-top height increases slightly with SST, accompanied by a large decrease in cloud fraction, whereas over trade cumulus (Cu) regions, cloud fraction decreases everywhere, to a smaller extent.",

CLUBB is a unified parameterization of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and shallow convection that is centered around a trivariate probability density function (PDF) and replaces the conventional PBL, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics schemes in CAM5. CAM-CLUBB improves many aspects of the base state climate compared to CAM5. Chief among them is the transition of stratocumulus to trade wind cumulus regions in the subtropical oceans. In these regions, CAM-CLUBB provides a much more gradual transition that is in better agreement with observational analysis compared to CAM5, which is too abrupt. The improvement seen in CAM-CLUBB can be largely attributed to the gradual evolution of the simulated turbulence, which is in part a result of the unified nature of the parameterization, and to the general improved representation of shallow cumulus clouds compared to CAM5. In addition, there are large differences in the representation and structure of marine boundary layer clouds between CAM-CLUBB and CAM5. CAM-CLUBB is also shown to be more robust, in terms of boundary layer clouds, to changes in vertical resolution for global simulations in a preliminary test.",

Using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we calculate relationships between aerosol optical depth tau(a), derived liquid cloud droplet effective number concentration Ne and liquid cloud droplet effective radius r(e) at different spatial scales. Generally, positive values of dlnN(e)/dln tau(a) are found for ocean regions, whilst negative values occur for many land regions. The spatial distribution of dlnr(e)/dln tau(a) shows approximately the opposite pattern, with generally postive values for land regions and negative values for ocean regions. We find that for region sizes larger than 4 degrees x 4 degrees, spurious spatial variations in retrieved cloud and aerosol properties can introduce widespread significant errors to calculations of dlnN(e)/dln tau(a) and dlnr(e)/dln tau(a). For regions on the scale of 60 degrees x 60 degrees, these methodological errors may lead to an overestimate in global cloud albedo effect radiative forcing of order 80{\%} relative to that calculated for regions on the scale of 1 degrees x 1 degrees.",

abstract="A new moist turbulence parameterization is presented and implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). It is derived from Grenier and Bretherton but has been heavily modified to improve its numerical stability and efficiency with the long time steps used in climate models. A goal was to provide a more physically realistic treatment of marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layers than in the current CAM. Key features of the scheme include use of moist-conserved variables, an explicit entrainment closure for convective layers, diagnosis of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for computation of turbulent diffusivities, an efficient new formulation of TKE transport as a relaxation to layer-mean TKE, and unified treatment of all turbulent layers in each atmospheric column. The scheme is compared with the default turbulence parameterizations in the CAM using three single-column modeling cases, using both operational and high vertical and time resolution. Both schemes performed comparably well on the dry convective boundary layer case. For a stable boundary layer case, the default CAM overdeepens the boundary layer unless its free-tropospheric mixing length is greatly reduced, whereupon the new scheme and default CAM again both perform well at both tested resolutions. A nocturnal stratocumulus case was much better simulated by the new scheme than the default CAM, with much less resolution sensitivity. Global climate simulations with the new scheme in tandem with a new shallow cumulus parameterization are presented in a companion paper.",

abstract="A new two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme in a general circulation model is described. Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/ evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations.",

abstract="Every cloud parameterization contains structural model errors. The source of these errors is difficult to pinpoint because cloud parameterizations contain nonlinearities and feedbacks. To elucidate these model inadequacies, this paper uses a general-purpose ensemble parameter estimation technique. In principle, the technique is applicable to any parameterization that contains a number of adjustable coefficients. It optimizes or calibrates parameter values by attempting to match predicted fields to reference datasets. Rather than striving to find the single best set of parameter values, the output is instead an ensemble of parameter sets. This ensemble provides a wealth of information. In particular, it can help uncover model deficiencies and structural errors that might not otherwise be easily revealed. The calibration technique is applied to an existing single-column model (SCM) that parameterizes boundary layer clouds. The SCM is a higher-order turbulence closure model. It is closed using a multivariate probability density function (PDF) that represents subgrid-scale variability. Reference datasets are provided by large-eddy simulations (LES) of a variety of cloudy boundary layers. The calibration technique locates some model errors in the SCM. As a result, empirical modifications are suggested. These modifications are evaluated with independent datasets and found to lead to an overall improvement in the SCM's performance.",

pages="1023--1042",
abstract="Parameterizations of turbulence often predict several lower-order moments and make closure assumptions for higher-order moments. In principle, the low- and high-order moments share the same probability density function (PDF). One closure assumption, then, is the shape of this family of PDFs. When the higher-order moments involve both velocity and thermodynamic scalars, often the PDF shape has been assumed to be a double or triple delta function. This is equivalent to assuming a mass-flux model with no subplume variability. However, PDF families other than delta functions can be assumed. This is because the assumed PDF methodology is fairly general. This paper proposes closures for several third- and fourth-order moments. To derive the closures, the moments are assumed to be consistent with a particular PDF family, namely, a mixture of two trivariate Gaussians. (This PDF is also called a double Gaussian or binormal PDF by some authors.) Separately from the PDF assumption, the paper also proposes a simplified relationship between scalar and velocity skewnesses. This PDF family and skewness relationship are simple enough to yield simple, analytic closure formulas relating the moments. If certain conditions hold, this set of moments is specifically realizable. By this it is meant that the set of moments corresponds to a real Gaussian-mixture PDF, one that is normalized and nonnegative everywhere. This paper compares the new closure formulas with both large eddy simulations (LESs) and closures based on double and triple delta PDFs. This paper does not implement the closures in a single-column model and test them interactively. Rather, the comparisons are diagnostic; that is, low-order moments are extracted from the LES and treated as givens that are input into the closures. This isolates errors in the closures from errors in a single-column model. The test cases are three atmospheric boundary layers: a trade wind cumulus layer, a stratocumulus layer, and a clear convective case. The new closures have shortcomings, but nevertheless are superior to the double or triple delta closures in most of the cases tested.",

Reflectivity to rain rate (Z-R) relationships are determined from shipboard raindrop-size distribution measurements obtained from observations using filter-paper, and compared to Z-R relationships derived from aircraft probe data from below north-east Atlantic drizzling Sc and stratus. A model for the evaporation and sedimentation of drizzle is combined with reflectivity profiles from a millimetre-wavelength cloud radar to derive information on the mean raindrop radius and drizzle drop concentrations at cloud base, and to show how Z-R relationships change with height below the cloud base. The Z-R relationships are used in conjunction with shipborne C-band radar reflectivity data to estimate areal average precipitation with uncertainties at cloud base and at the surface. In the Sc drizzle Z-R relationship, Z = aR(b) (where a and b are constants), the estimated exponent b = 1.1 to 1.4 is lower than commonly observed in deep convective rain (b = 1.5). Analyses indicate that variations in Sc rain rates and reflectivities are influenced both by fluctuations in drizzle drop concentration and in mean radius, but that number concentration contributes more to the modulation of rain rate in Sc. Rain rates derived using the scanning C-band radar are found to be spatially variable, with much of the accumulation originating from a small fraction of the drizzling area. The observations also suggest that rain rate in marine Sc is strongly dependent on cloud liquid-water path, and inversely correlated with cloud droplet concentration.",

abstract="Climate model parameterization of precipitation formation in boundary layer stratocumulus clouds is a challenge that needs to be carefully addressed for simulations of the aerosol impact on precipitation and on cloud life time and extent, the so-called second indirect effect of aerosol on climate. Existing schemes are generally tuned against global observations of the liquid water path, as very few in situ observations are available for their validation. This issue is addressed here with data collected during the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. The methodology is different from previous experimental studies in the sense that each case study is first analyzed for retrieving properties that are representative of the observed cloud system as a whole, such as the cloud system geometrical thickness, droplet concentration, precipitation flux, etc. Special attention is given to the characterization of the droplet number concentration by deriving a value that is representative of the aerosol activation process instead of the mean value over the cloud system. The analysis then focuses on the variability of these cloud system values for eight case studies with different aerosol backgrounds. The data set reveals that precipitation forms when the maximum mean volume droplet radius in the cloud layer reaches values >10 mum, the same critical value as previously used in cloud resolving models. This maximum radius can be predicted with an adiabatic diagnostic on the basis of cloud geometrical thickness and droplet number concentration. The measured reduction rate of drizzle water content by precipitation is also compared to predictions of auto-conversion and accretion production rates derived from existing bulk parameterizations initialized with the measured values of cloud droplet and drizzle water content. The good agreement with the parameterizations suggests that the cloud layer reaches a nearly steady state characterized by a balance between the production and reduction rates of cloud and drizzle water content. Finally, it is shown that the cloud system precipitation rate can be expressed as a power law of cloud geometrical thickness and cloud droplet number concentration, hence providing a simple large-scale parameterization of the precipitation process in boundary layer clouds.",

Obtaining accurate data at the required small scales is also challenging, for both simulations and measurements. During the past few decades, however, high-resolution simulations and measurements have greatly advanced our understanding of the main mechanisms controlling cloud entrainment.

abstract="It appears that the Met Office general-circulation model (GCM) represents stratocumulus over the northeast subtropical Pacific Ocean quite accurately-the mean cloud cover is realistically high, the observed mean and diurnal cycle of liquid-water path is well represented and the capping inversion is at a reasonable height. This suggests that the boundary-layer thermodynamic budget must also be well modelled. However, one of the dominant terms in this budget is cloud-top entrainment, which is parametrized explicitly in this model, and is still the subject of much debate in the literature. In order to quantify the sensitivity of the GCM to this parametrization, the results of simulations applying three perturbations of entrainment formulation are presented. One change, to the enhancement of entrainment in the buoyancy-reversal regime, is found to have little impact. The other two led to a significant reduction of the cloudiness in the stratocumulus area, giving worse agreement with observations. The first of these was to increase the parametrized entrainment rate by a factor of two. The second was to remove the coupling of the entrainment fluxes to the radiative and resolved advective fluxes, an aspect of the implementation previously found necessary to prevent serious numerical errors which generated spurious additional entrainment. It is further hypothesized that the numerical errors can be associated with a signal in the surface heat fluxes in the north-east Pacific atratocumulus area. This signal can be seen in many other GCMs, suggesting that numerical problems associated with mixing across sharp inversions may be prevalent.",

abstract="Mixed-layer theory is used to synthesize and evaluate recently proposed entrainment parametrizations (rules) for the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. The results illustrate that recently proposed entrainment rules exhibit marked differences. Significant differences are found between rules derived from a single set of simulations and rules derived from different sets of simulations. Such differences imply steady-state boundary layers that can differ by as much as a factor of two in climatologically important properties such as vertically integrated liquid water and boundary-layer depth. In addition, surface fluxes depend significantly on entrainment, as do different measures for the limits of applicability of the mixed-layer theory. Moreover, differences among proposed entrainment rules yield steady states with different equilibrium sensitivities; models closed with some rules are more sensitive to divergence while others are more sensitive to variations in the sea surface temperature. Overall we expect that these differences should be evident in the climatology and climate sensitivity of stratocumulus derived from models which use these rules. This degree of sensitivity encourages attempts to bound entrainment rules observationally, by requiring consistency with the observed stratocumulus climatology. The analysis also encourages the use of somewhat simpler strategies for the parametrization of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer in large-scale models.",

During five of seven analyzed flights precipitation was evident at the surface, and on roughly a third of the flights mean surface rates approached or exceeded 0.5 mm day(-1). Additional analysis of the structure and variability of drizzle indicates that the macroscopic (flight averaged) mean drizzle rates at cloud base scale with H-3/N where H is the flight-averaged cloud depth and N the flight-averaged cloud droplet number concentration. To a lesser extent flight-to-flight variability in the mean drizzle rate also scales well with differences in the 11- and 4-mum brightness temperatures, and the cloud-top effective radius. The structure of stratocumulus boundary layers with precipitation reaching the surface is also investigated, and a general picture emerges of large flight-averaged drizzle rates being manifested primarily through the emergence of intense pockets of precipitation. The characteristics of the drizzle spectrum in precipitating versus nonprecipitating regions of a particular cloud layer were mostly distinguished by the number of drizzle drops present, rather than a change in size of the median drizzle drop, or the breadth of the drizzle spectrum.",

abstract="Marine cold air outbreaks (CAOs) commonly form overcast cloud decks that transition into broken cloud fields downwind, dramatically altering the local radiation budget. In this study, we investigate the impact of frozen hydrometeors on these transitions. We focus on a CAO case in the NW Atlantic, the location of the multi-year flight campaign ACTIVATE (Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment). We use MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) reanalysis fields to drive large eddy simulations with mixed-phase two-moment microphysics in a Lagrangian framework. We find that transitions are triggered by substantial rain (rainwater paths >25 g m(-2)), and only simulations that allow for aerosol depletion result in sustained breakups, as observed. Using a range of diagnostic ice nucleating particle concentrations, Ninp, we find that increasing ice progressively accelerates transitions, thus abbreviating the overcast state. Ice particles affect the cloud-topped boundary layer evolution, primarily through riming-related processes prior to substantial rain, leading to (1) a reduction in cloud liquid water, (2) early consumption of cloud condensation nuclei, and (3) early and light precipitation cooling and moistening below cloud. We refer to these three effects collectively as ``preconditioning by riming''. Greater boundary layer aerosol concentrations available as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) delay the onset of substantial rain. However, cloud breakup and low CCN concentration final stages are found to be inevitable in this case, due, primarily, to liquid water path buildup. An ice-modulated cloud transition speed suggests the possibility of a negative cloud-climate feedback. To address prevailing uncertainties in the model representation of mixed-phase processes, the magnitude of ice formation and riming impacts and, thereby, the strength of an associated negative cloud-climate feedback process, requires further observational evaluation by targeting riming hot spots with in situ imaging probes that allow for both the characterization of ice particles and abundance of supercooled droplets.",

abstract="Parametric functions are currently used to represent droplet spectra in clouds and to develop bulk parameterizations of the microphysical processes and of their interactions with radiation. The most frequently used parametric functions are the Lognormal and the Generalized Gamma which have three and four independent parameters, respectively. In a bulk parameterization, two parameters are constrained by the total droplet number concentration and the liquid water content. In the Generalized Gamma function, one parameter is specified a priori, and the fourth one, like the third parameter of the Lognormal function, shall be tuned, for the parametric function to statistically best fit observed droplet spectra. These parametric functions are evaluated here using droplet spectra collected in non-or slightly precipitating stratocumulus and shallow cumulus. Optimum values of the tuning parameters are derived by minimizing either the absolute or the relative error for successively the first, second, fifth, and sixth moments of the droplet size distribution. A trade-off value is also proposed that minimizes both absolute and relative errors for the four moments concomitantly. Finally, a parameterization is proposed in which the tuning parameter depends on the liquid water content. This approach significantly improves the fit for the smallest and largest values of the moments.",

Simulations show that the closed-cell mesoscale cellular convection is driven by positive feedback from cloud-induced mesoscale perturbations of longwave radiative cooling. A conceptual model for closed-cell stratocumulus as a mesoscale wavelength hydrodynamic instability in which mesoscale moist and dry anomalies spontaneously grow is presented. In simulations in which long-wavelength sinusoidal moisture anomalies are initially imposed, these anomalies evolve into amplifying closed cells. The cell structure is visualized with a compositing approach based on sorting grid columns by their mesoscale-smoothed total water path. A thermally direct mesoscale circulation pattern develops in the interior of the boundary layer with buoyant mesoscale updrafts, thicker cloud, and a slightly higher capping inversion in the moister columns. There is a mesoscale flow of above-inversion air down the slightly sloping capping inversion from the moist to the dry regions, reinforced by cloud top radiative cooling. This strengthens the mesoscale anomalies by preferentially cooling and drying the already dry regions. The sloping inversion flow is not driven as efficiently if the radiative cooling is artificially horizontally homogenized, partly disrupting this positive feedback and the resulting closed-cell development.",

abstract="The relative importance, for cloud-top entrainment, of the cooling rates due to longwave radiation, evaporation, and mixing was assessed through analysis of the results produced by a Lagrangian parcel-tracking model (LPTM) incorporated into a large-eddy simulation model. The LFTM predicts each parcel's trajectory over time, using the resolved velocity simulated by the host model. An LPTM makes it possible to identify entrained parcels; this is almost impossible to do in an observational study. A nocturnal stratocumulus cloud was simulated over 4 h using a 5-m horizontal grid spacing and a 2.5-m vertical grid spacing. At the start of the last hour of the simulation, over 40 million parcels were placed near the top of the inversion layer and then tracked. Parcel histories were analyzed to identify entrained parcels. Entrainment occurs in cloud holes, which occur in dry regions of sinking air. Entrainment into the mixed layer is regulated by buoyancy, which requires parcels to be precooled in the inversion layer, prior to entrainment. A mixing fraction analysis was used to separate the cooling due to longwave radiation, evaporation, and mixing. Results show that radiative and evaporative cooling are of comparable importance, but that mixing is by far the dominant cooling mechanism. The radiative cooling rate is strongly inhomogeneous, and only weak radiative cooling is found in regions of entrainment. Therefore, the entrained parcels experience less than the horizontal-mean radiative cooling. Although radiative cooling maintains the boundary layer turbulence, its direct effect on buoyancy of entrained parcels is modest.",

abstract="We revise the convective triggering function in Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) by introducing a dynamic constraint on the initiation of convection that emulates the collective dynamical effects to prevent convection from being triggered too frequently and allowing air parcels to launch above the boundary layer to capture nocturnal elevated convection. The former is referred to as the dynamic Convective Available Potential Energy (dCAPE) trigger and the latter as the Unrestricted Launch Level (ULL) trigger. Compared to the original trigger in EAMv1 that initiates convection whenever CAPE is larger than a threshold, the revised trigger substantially improves the simulated diurnal cycle of precipitation over both midlatitude and tropical lands. The nocturnal peak of precipitation and the eastward propagation of convection downstream of the Rockies and over the adjacent Great Plains are much better captured than those in the default model. The overall impact on mean precipitation is minor with some notable improvements over the Indo-Western Pacific, subtropical Pacific and Atlantic, and South America. In general, the dCAPE trigger helps to better capture late afternoon rainfall peak, while ULL is key to capturing nocturnal elevated convection and the eastward propagation of convection. The dCAPE trigger also primarily contributes to the considerable reduction of convective precipitation over subtropical regions and the frequency of light-to-moderate precipitation occurrence. However, no clear improvement is seen in intense convection and the amplitude of diurnal precipitation.",

abstract="A new cloudy boundary layer single-column model is presented. It is designed to be flexible enough to represent a variety of cloudiness regimes-such as cumulus, stratocumulus, and clear regimes-without the need for case-specific adjustments. The methodology behind the model is the so-called assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The parameterization differs from higher-order closure or mass-flux schemes in that it achieves closure by the use of a relatively sophisticated joint PDF of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture. A family of PDFs is chosen that is flexible enough to represent various cloudiness regimes. A double Gaussian family proposed by previous works is used. Predictive equations for grid box means and a number of higher-order turbulent moments are advanced in time. These moments are in turn used to select a particular member from the family of PDFs, for each time step and grid box. Once a PDF member has been selected, the scheme integrates over the PDF to close higher-order moments, buoyancy terms, and diagnose cloud fraction and liquid water. Since all the diagnosed moments for a given grid box and time step are derived from the same unique joint PDF, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another. A companion paper presents simulations produced by the single-column model.",

pages="407--446",
abstract="A simplified cumulus parameterization scheme, suitable for use in GCMs, is presented. This parameterization is based on a plume ensemble concept similar to that originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974). However, it employs three assumptions which significantly simplify the formulation and implementation of the scheme. It is assumed that an ensemble of convective-scale updrafts with associated saturated downdrafts may exist when the atmosphere is locally conditionally unstable in the lower troposphere. However, the updraft ensemble is comprised only of;hose plumes which are sufficiently buoyant to penetrate through this unstable layer. It is assumed that all such plumes have the same upward mass flux at the base of the convective layer. The third assumption is that moist convection, which occurs only when there is convective available potential energy (CAFE) for reversible ascent of an undiluted parcel from the sub-cloud layer, acts to remove CAFE at an exponential rate with a specified adjustment time scale. The performance of the scheme and its sensitivity to choices of disposable parameters is illustrated by presenting results from a series of idealized single-column model tests. These tests demonstrate that the scheme permits establishment of a quasi-equilibrium between large-scale forcing and convective response. However, it is also shown that the strength of convective downdrafts is an important factor in determining the nature of the equilibrium state. Relatively strong down-drafts give rise to an unsteady irregularly fluctuating state characterized by alternate periods of deep and shallow convection. The effect of using the scheme for GCM climate simulations is illustrated by presenting selected results of a multi-year simulation carried out with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM using the new parameterization (the CONV simulation). Comparison of these results with those for a climate simulation made with the standard model (the CONTROL simulation, as documented by McFarlane et al., 1992) reveals the importance of other parameterized processes in determining the ultimate effect of introducing the new convective scheme. The radiative response to changes in the cloudiness regime is particularly important in this regard.",

abstract="A new refinement of Albrecht et al.'s bulk model for shallow-cumulus convection is presented. It is used to illuminate fundamental aspects of oceanic shallow-cumulus boundary layer structure, including updraft buoyancy and vertical velocity scales, cumulus mass flux, temperature and humidity profiles, and trade-inversion height. The new model, like Albrecht et al.'s, includes a subcloud mixed layer and a cumulus layer with linear gradients of conserved thermodynamic variables, topped by a sharp capping inversion. Albrecht et al.'s model was not mathematically well posed, leading to an inconsistency between its heat and moisture balances at the inversion base. The new bulk model resolves this problem by diagnosing, rather than prognosing, the cumulus-layer gradients and introducing a penetrative entrainment closure to determine the growth of the cumulus layer into the overlying free troposphere. It uses more realistic assumptions about lateral cumulus entrainment and detrainment and a simplified sub-cloud-layer entrainment closure. When applied to a Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) trade-cumulus case, the steady state and the transient response of the bulk model to a sudden increase in sea surface temperature both compare favorably to a large-eddy simulation (LES). The new closure shows that penetrative entrainment constantly adjusts the cumulus-layer temperature and moisture profiles to keep the updraft buoyancy and vertical velocity small in inverse proportion to a penetrative entrainment efficiency A, estimated to be 5 from LES. Energy-balance arguments provide a skillful prediction of the steady-state bulk-model trade-inversion height. They also show that penetrative entrainment is driven by destabilization of the cumulus layer by radiative cooling and Lagrangian surface temperature increases.",
